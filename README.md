# Ansible Collection: community.general

This repo contains the `community.general` Ansible Collection.

The collection includes the modules and plugins supported by Ansible community.


## Installation and Usage

### Installing the Collection from Ansible Galaxy

Before using the General community collection, you need to install the collection with the `ansible-galaxy` CLI:

    ansible-galaxy collection install community.general

You can also include it in a `requirements.yml` file and install it via `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml` using the format:

```yaml
collections:
- name: community.general
```

## Testing and Development

If you want to develop new content for this collection or improve what is already here, the easiest way to work on the collection is to clone it into one of the configured [`COLLECTIONS_PATHS`](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/config.html#collections-paths), and work on it there.

You can find more information in the [developer guide for collections](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/dev_guide/developing_collections.html#contributing-to-collections)

### Testing with `ansible-test`

See [here](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/dev_guide/developing_collections.html#testing-collections).
