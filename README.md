# Community General Collection

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/ansible/community.general/_apis/build/status/CI?branchName=stable-6)](https://dev.azure.com/ansible/community.general/_build?definitionId=31)
[![EOL CI](https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/workflows/EOL%20CI/badge.svg?event=push)](https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/actions)
[![Codecov](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/ansible-collections/community.general)](https://codecov.io/gh/ansible-collections/community.general)

This repository contains the `community.general` Ansible Collection. The collection is a part of the Ansible package and includes many modules and plugins supported by Ansible community which are not part of more specialized community collections.

You can find [documentation for this collection on the Ansible docs site](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/community/general/).

Please note that this collection does **not** support Windows targets. Only connection plugins included in this collection might support Windows targets, and will explicitly mention that in their documentation if they do so.

## Code of Conduct

We follow [Ansible Code of Conduct](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/code_of_conduct.html) in all our interactions within this project.

If you encounter abusive behavior violating the [Ansible Code of Conduct](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/code_of_conduct.html), please refer to the [policy violations](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/code_of_conduct.html#policy-violations) section of the Code of Conduct for information on how to raise a complaint.

## Tested with Ansible

Tested with the current ansible-core 2.11, ansible-core 2.12, ansible-core 2.13, ansible-core 2.14 releases and the current development version of ansible-core. Ansible-core versions before 2.11.0 are not supported. This includes all ansible-base 2.10 and Ansible 2.9 releases.

Parts of this collection will not work with ansible-core 2.11 on Python 3.12+.

## External requirements

Some modules and plugins require external libraries. Please check the requirements for each plugin or module you use in the documentation to find out which requirements are needed.

## Included content

Please check the included content on the [Ansible Galaxy page for this collection](https://galaxy.ansible.com/community/general) or the [documentation on the Ansible docs site](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/community/general/).

## Using this collection

This collection is shipped with the Ansible package. So if you have it installed, no more action is required.

If you have a minimal installation (only Ansible Core installed) or you want to use the latest version of the collection along with the whole Ansible package, you need to install the collection from [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/community/general) manually with the `ansible-galaxy` command-line tool:

    ansible-galaxy collection install community.general

You can also include it in a `requirements.yml` file and install it via `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml` using the format:

```yaml
collections:
- name: community.general
```

Note that if you install the collection manually, it will not be upgraded automatically when you upgrade the Ansible package. To upgrade the collection to the latest available version, run the following command:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install community.general --upgrade
```

You can also install a specific version of the collection, for example, if you need to downgrade when something is broken in the latest version (please report an issue in this repository). Use the following syntax where `X.Y.Z` can be any [available version](https://galaxy.ansible.com/community/general):

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install community.general:==X.Y.Z
```

See [Ansible Using collections](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/collections_using.html) for more details.
