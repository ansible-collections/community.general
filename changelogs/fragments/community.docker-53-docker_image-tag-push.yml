bugfixes:
- "docker_image - if ``push=true`` is used with ``repository``, and the image does not need to be tagged, still push. This can happen if ``repository`` and ``name`` are equal (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/52, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/53)."
