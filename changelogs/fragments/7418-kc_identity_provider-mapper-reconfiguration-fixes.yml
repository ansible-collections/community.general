bugfixes:
  - keycloak_identity_provider - it was not possible to reconfigure (add, remove) ``mappers`` once they were created initially. Removal was ignored, adding new ones resulted in dropping the pre-existing unmodified mappers. Fix resolves the issue by supplying correct input to the internal update call (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/7418).
  - keycloak_identity_provider - ``mappers`` processing was not idempotent if the mappers configuration list had not been sorted by name (in ascending order). Fix resolves the issue by sorting mappers in the desired state using the same key which is used for obtaining existing state (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/7418).
