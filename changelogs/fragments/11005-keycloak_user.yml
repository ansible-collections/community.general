security_fixes:
  - "keycloak_user - the parameter ``credentials[].value`` is now marked as ``no_log=true``. Before it was logged by Ansible, unless the task was marked as ``no_log: true``.
     Since this parameter can be used for passwords, this resulted in credential leaking
     (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/issues/11000, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/11005)."
