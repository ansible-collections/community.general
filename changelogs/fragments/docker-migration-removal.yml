  All ``docker`` modules and plugins have been removed from this collection.
  They have been migrated to the `community.docker <https://galaxy.ansible.com/community/docker>`_ collection.
  For users of ansible-base 2.10 or newer, redirections have been provided.

  Users of Ansible 2.9 using this collection need to adjust their FQCNs (``community.general.docker_container`` â†’ ``community.docker.docker_container``) and make sure to install the community.docker collection.

- >
  For Ansible 2.9 users which use ``docker`` plugins or modules from this collections 2.0.0 results in errors when trying to use the docker content by FQCN, like ``community.general.docker_container``.
  Since Ansible 2.9 is not able to use redirections, users have to adjust their playbooks and roles manually to use the new FQCNs (``community.docker.docker_container`` for the previous example) and to make sure they have ``community.docker`` installed.

  If you are a user of ansible-base 2.10 or newer who did not install Ansible 2.11, but installed (and/or upgraded) community.general manually, you need to make sure to also install ``community.docker`` if you are using any of the ``docker`` plugins or modules.
  While ansible-base 2.10 or newer can use the redirects that community.general 2.0.0 adds, the collection they point to (community.docker) must be installed for them to work.
