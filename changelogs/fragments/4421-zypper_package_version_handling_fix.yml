bugfixes:
  - zypper - fixed bug that caused zypper to always report [ok] and do nothing on ``state=present`` when all packages in ``name`` had a version specification (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/issues/4371, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/4421).
