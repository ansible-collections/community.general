minor_changes:
  - proxmox inventory plugin - adds an option to exclude nodes from the dynamic inventory generation. The new setting is optional, not using this option will behave as usual (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/issues/6714, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/7461).
