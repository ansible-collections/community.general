bugfixes:
  - module_helper module utils - avoid failing when non-zero ``rc`` is present on regular exit (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/2912).
  - snap - fix various bugs which prevented the module from working at all, and which resulted in ``state=absent`` fail on absent snaps (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/issues/2835, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/issues/2906, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/2912).
