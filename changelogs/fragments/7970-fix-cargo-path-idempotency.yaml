bugfixes:
  - "cargo - fix idempotency issues when using a custom installation path
    for packages (using the ``--path`` parameter).
    The initial installation runs fine, but subsequent runs use the
    ``get_installed()`` function which did not check the given installation
    location, before running ``cargo install``. This resulted in a false
    ``changed`` state.
    Also the removal of packeges using ``state: absent`` failed, as the
    installation check did not use the given parameter
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/7970)."
