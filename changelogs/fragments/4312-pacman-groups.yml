bugfixes:
  - pacman - Use ``--groups`` instead of ``--group``
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/4312).

known_issues:
   - pacman - Binaries specified in the ``executable`` parameter must support
     ``--print-format`` in order to be used by this module.
     In particular, AUR helper ``yay`` is known not to currently support it.
