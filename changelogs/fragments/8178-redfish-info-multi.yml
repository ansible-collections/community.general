breaking_changes:
  - redfish_info - modify ``GetLogs`` and ``GetNetworkProtocols`` commands to support multi-manager node types. These commands will return a list of dictionaries similar to the ``GetManagerInventory`` and ``GetSystemInventory`` commands instead of a single dictionary (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/issues/6764).
