  For community.general 2.0.0, the kubevirt modules will be moved to the `community.kubevirt <https://galaxy.ansible.com/community/kubevirt>`_ collection.
  A redirection will be inserted so that users using ansible-base 2.10 or newer do not have to change anything.

  If you use Ansible 2.9 and explicitly use kubevirt modules from this collection, you will need to adjust your playbooks and roles to use FQCNs starting with ``community.kubevirt.`` instead of ``community.general.``,
  for example replace ``community.general.kubevirt_vm`` in a task by ``community.kubevirt.kubevirt_vm``.

  If you use ansible-base and installed ``community.general`` manually and rely on the kubevirt modules, you have to make sure to install the ``community.kubevirt`` collection as well.
  If you are using FQCNs, for example ``community.general.kubevirt_vm`` instead of ``kubevirt_vm``, it will continue working, but we still recommend to adjust the FQCNs as well.
