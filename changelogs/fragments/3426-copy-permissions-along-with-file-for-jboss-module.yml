bugfixes:
  - jboss - fix the deployment file permission issue when Jboss server is running 
    under non-root user. The deployment file is copied with file content only. The 
    file permission is set to ``440`` and belongs to root user. When the
    JBoss ``WildFly`` server is running under non-root user, it is unable to read
    the deployment file (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/3426).
