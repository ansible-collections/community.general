minor_changes:
  - openbsd_pkg - add support for removing unused dependencies with ``state=rm_unused_deps`` and ``name='*'``. This feature uses OpenBSD's ``pkg_delete -a`` command to remove packages that are no longer required by any other packages. Supports check mode, diff mode, and all existing module options like ``clean`` and ``quick`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/10705).
