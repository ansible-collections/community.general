minor_changes:
  - openbsd_pkg - add ``autoremove`` parameter to remove unused dependencies. When set to ``true``, uses OpenBSD's ``pkg_delete -a`` command to remove packages that are no longer required. Works with specific package names or ``name='*'`` to remove all unused dependencies. Supports check mode, diff mode, and all existing module options like ``clean`` and ``quick`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/10705).
