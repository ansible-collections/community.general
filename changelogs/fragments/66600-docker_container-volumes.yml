minor_changes:
- "docker_container - only passes anonymous volumes to docker daemon as ``Volumes``. This increases compatibility with the ``docker`` CLI program. Note that if you specify ``volumes: strict`` in ``comparisons``, this could cause existing containers created with docker_container from Ansible 2.9 or earlier to restart."
