minor_changes:
  - shutdown - if no shutdown commands are found in the ``search_paths`` then the module will attempt to shutdown the system using ``systemctl shutdown`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/issues/4269, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/6171).
