minor_changes:
  - "pkgng - added support for upgrading all packages using ``name: *, state: latest``, similar to other package providers (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/569)."
breaking_changes:
  - "pkgng - passing ``name: *`` with ``state: latest`` or ``state: present`` will no longer install every package from the configured package repositories. Instead, ``name: *, state: latest`` will upgrade all already-installed packages, and ``name: *, state: present`` is a noop. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/569)."
  - "pkgng - passing ``name: *`` with ``state: absent`` will no longer remove every installed package from the system. It is now a noop. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/569)."
