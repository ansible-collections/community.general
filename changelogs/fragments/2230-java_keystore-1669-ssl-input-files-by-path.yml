minor_changes:
  - "java_keystore - add options ``certificate_path`` and ``private_key_path``,
    mutually exclusive with ``certificate`` and ``private_key`` respectively, and
    targetting files on remote hosts rather than their contents on the controller.
    Refactor documentation: document new options, add info for better understanding
    of what options fail and what options overwrite the keystore when their values
    change, fix indentation, use present tenses. Refactor integration tests to run
    the same tasks twice: one as before and one with the new options
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/issues/1669)."
