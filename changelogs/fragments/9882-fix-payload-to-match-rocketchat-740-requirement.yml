    RocketChat module - attribute ``option_is_pre740`` has been added to match the old payload. The argument default value could be set to false in a few months and then,
    removed in a future release when Rocket Chat 7.4.0 is considered as a minimum version to be used (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/9882).
