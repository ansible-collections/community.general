minor_changes:
  - "Remove vendored copy of ``distutils.version`` in favor of vendored copy included with ansible-core 2.12+. For ansible-core 2.11, uses ``distutils.version`` for Python < 3.12. There is no support for ansible-core 2.11 with Python 3.12+ (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/3988)."
