deprecated_features:
- docker_container - the ``trust_image_content`` option will be removed. It has always been ignored by the module.
- docker_stack - the return values ``err`` and ``out`` have been deprecated. Use ``stdout`` and ``stderr`` from now on instead.
- redfish_config - the ``bios_attribute_name`` and ``bios_attribute_value`` options will be removed. To maintain the existing behavior use the ``bios_attributes`` option instead.
- redfish_config and redfish_command - the behavior to select the first System, Manager, or Chassis resource to modify when multiple are present will be removed. Use the new ``resource_id`` option to specify target resource to modify.
- clc_aa_policy - the ``wait`` parameter will be removed. It has always been ignored by the module.
- zabbix_proxy - deprecates ``interface`` sub-options ``type`` and ``main`` when proxy type is set to passive via ``status=passive``. Make sure these suboptions are removed from your playbook as they were never supported by Zabbix in the first place.

breaking_changes:
- hashi_vault lookup - now returns the latest version when using the KV v2 secrets engine. Previously, it returned all versions of the secret which required additional steps to extract and filter the desired version.
- datadog - the parameter ``message`` was renamed to ``notification_message`` since ``message`` is used by Ansible Core engine internally.
- bigpanda - the parameter ``message`` was renamed to ``deployment_message`` since ``message`` is used by Ansible Core engine internally.
- "docker_container - no longer passes information on non-anonymous volumes or binds as ``Volumes`` to the Docker daemon. This increases compatibility with the ``docker`` CLI program. Note that if you specify ``volumes: strict`` in ``comparisons``, this could cause existing containers created with docker_container from Ansible 2.9 or earlier to restart."
- "docker_container - support for port ranges was adjusted to be more compatible to the ``docker`` command line utility: a one-port container range combined with a multiple-port host range will no longer result in only the first host port be used, but the whole range being passed to Docker so that a free port in that range will be used."

major_changes:
- docker_container - the module has a new option, ``container_default_behavior``, whose default value will change from ``compatibility`` to ``no_defaults``. Set to an explicit value to avoid deprecation warnings.
- docker_container - the ``network_mode`` option will be set by default to the name of the first network in ``networks`` if at least one network is given and ``networks_cli_compatible`` is ``true`` (will be default from community.general 2.0.0 on). Set to an explicit value to avoid deprecation warnings if you specify networks and set ``networks_cli_compatible`` to ``true``. The current default (not specifying it) is equivalent to the value ``default``.
- zabbix_action - no longer requires ``esc_period`` and ``event_source`` arguments when ``state=absent``.
- gitlab_user - no longer requires ``name``, ``email`` and ``password`` arguments when ``state=absent``.
