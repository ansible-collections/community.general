deprecated_features:
  - "The proxmox content (modules and plugins) has been moved to the `new collection community.proxmox <https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.proxmox>`__.
     In community.general 11.0.0, these modules and plugins will be replaced by deprecated redirections to community.proxmox.
     You need to explicitly install community.proxmox, for example with ``ansible-galaxy collection install community.proxmox``,
     or by installing a new enough version of the Ansible community package.
     We suggest to update your roles and playbooks to use the new FQCNs as soon as possible to avoid getting deprecation messages
     (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/10109)."
