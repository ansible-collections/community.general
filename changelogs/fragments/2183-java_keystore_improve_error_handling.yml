bugfixes:
  - "java_keystore - improve error handling and return ``cmd`` as documented.
    Force ``LANG``, ``LC_ALL`` and ``LC_MESSAGES`` environment variables to ``C`` to rely
    on ``keytool`` output parsing. Fix pylint's ``unused-variable`` and ``no-else-return``
    hints (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/2183)."
