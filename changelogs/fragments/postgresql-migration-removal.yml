  All ``postgresql`` modules have been removed from this collection.
  They have been migrated to the `community.postgresql <https://galaxy.ansible.com/community/postgresql>`_ collection.
  If you use ansible-base 2.10 or newer, redirections have been provided.
  If you use Ansible 2.9 and installed this collection, you need to adjust the FQCNs (``community.general.postgresql_info`` â†’ ``community.postgresql.postgresql_info``) and make sure to install the community.postgresql collection.

  If you use Ansible 2.9 and the ``postgresql`` modules from this collections, community.general 2.0.0 results in errors when trying to use the postgresql content by FQCN, like ``community.general.postgresql_info``.
  Since Ansible 2.9 is not able to use redirections, you will have to adjust your playbooks and roles manually to use the new FQCNs (``community.postgresql.postgresql_info`` for the previous example) and to make sure that you have ``community.postgresql`` installed.
  If you use ansible-base 2.10 or newer and did not install Ansible 3.0.0, but installed (and/or upgraded) community.general manually, you need to make sure to also install ``community.postgresql`` if you are using any of the ``postgresql`` modules.
  While ansible-base 2.10 or newer can use the redirects that community.general 2.0.0 adds, the collection they point to (community.postgresql) must be installed for them to work.
