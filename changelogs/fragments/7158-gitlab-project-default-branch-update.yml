breaking_changes:
  - gitlab_project - add ``default_branch`` support for project update. If you used the module so far with ``default_branch`` to update a project, the value of ``default_branch`` was ignored. Make sure that you either do not pass a value if you are not sure whether it is the one you want to have to avoid unexpected breaking changes (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/7158).
