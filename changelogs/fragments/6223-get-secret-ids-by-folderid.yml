minor_changes:
  - tss lookup plugin - allow to fetch secret IDs which are in a folder based on folder ID. Previously, we could not fetch secrets based on folder ID but now use ``fetch_secret_ids_from_folder`` option to indicate to fetch secret IDs based on folder ID (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/issues/6223).
