deprecated_features:
  - |
    rhn_channel, rhn_register - RHN hosted at redhat.com was discontinued years
    ago, and Spacewalk 5 (which uses RHN) is EOL since 2020, May 31st;
    while these modules could work on Uyuni / SUSE Manager (fork of Spacewalk 5),
    we have not heard about anyone using them in those setups. Hence, these
    modules are deprecated, and will be removed in community.general 10.0.0
    in case there are no reports about being still useful, and potentially
    noone that steps up to maintain them
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/6493).
