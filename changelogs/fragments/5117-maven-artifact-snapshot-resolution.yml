bugfixes:
  - maven_artifact - fix SNAPSHOT version resolution to use the ``<snapshot>`` metadata block (timestamp + buildNumber) which always points to the latest build, instead of picking the first matching ``<snapshotVersion>`` entry. Repositories like GitHub Packages keep all historical entries in ``<snapshotVersions>`` (oldest first), causing the module to resolve to the oldest snapshot instead of the latest (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/issues/5117, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/issues/11489).
