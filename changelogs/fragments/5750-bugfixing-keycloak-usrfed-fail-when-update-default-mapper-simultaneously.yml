bugfixes:
  - >-
    keycloak_user_federation - fixes federation creation issue. When a new
    federation was created and at the same time a default / standard mapper
    was also changed / updated the creation process failed as a bad None
    set variable led to a bad malformed url request
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/5750).
