minor_changes:
- nagios - rename the ``service_check`` action to ``forced_check`` since we now are able to check both a particular service, all services of a particular host and the host itself (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/998).
- nagios - add the ``host`` and ``all`` values for the ``forced_check`` action (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/998).
