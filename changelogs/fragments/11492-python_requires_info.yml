bugfixes:
  - "python_requirements_info - use ``importlib.metadata`` if ``pkg_resources`` from ``setuptools`` cannot be imported.
     That module has been removed from setuptools 82.0.0
     (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/issues/11491, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/11492)."
