bugfixes:
  - "Various modules and plugins - use vendored version of ``distutils.version`` included in ansible-core 2.12 if available. This avoids breakage when ``distutils`` is removed from the standard library of Python 3.12. Note that ansible-core 2.11, ansible-base 2.10 and Ansible 2.9 are right now not compatible with Python 3.12, hence this fix does not target these ansible-core/-base/2.9 versions (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/3936)."
known_issues:
  - "Various modules - all modules that are now using the vendored version of ``distutils.version`` included in ansible-core 2.12 if available no longer work on Ansible 2.9 before 2.9.20, and ansible-base 2.10 before 2.10.8. If you are using one of these Ansible and ansible-base versions, please upgrade to Ansible 2.9.20 or newer, or ansible-base 2.10.8 or newer. The modules affected are ``circonus_annotation``, ``clc_*``, ``dnsimple``, ``dpkg_divert``, ``filesystem``, ``flatpak``, ``gitlab_*``, ``homebrew_cask``, ``htpasswd`` ``influxdb_*``, ``ipa_subca``, ``kibana_plugin``, ``mas``, ``mqtt, ``openbsd_pkg``, ``pids``, ``proxmox``, ``proxmox_kvm``, ``python_requirements_info``, ``rax_cbs``, ``sendgrid``, ``terraform``, ``xml``, and ``zypper_repository`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/3936, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/3979)."
