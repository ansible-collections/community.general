bugfixes:
  - ldap_attrs - fix bug which caused a ``Bad search filter`` error. The error was occuring when the ldap attribute value contained special characters such as ``(`` or ``*`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/issues/5434, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/5435).
