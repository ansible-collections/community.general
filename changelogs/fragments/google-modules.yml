minor_changes:
- Add the deprecated ``gcp_backend_service``, ``gcp_forwarding_rule`` and ``gcp_healthcheck`` modules, which will be removed in 2.0.0. These were originally in community.general, but removed on the assumption that they have been moved to google.cloud. Since this turned out to be incorrect, we re-added them for 1.0.0.
- Add the ``gcpubsub``, ``gcpubsub_info`` and ``gcpubsub_facts`` (to be removed in 3.0.0) modules. These were originally in community.general, but removed on the assumption that they have been moved to google.cloud. Since this turned out to be incorrect, we re-added them for 1.0.0.
