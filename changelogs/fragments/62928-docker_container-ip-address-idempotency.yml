bugfixes:
- "docker_container - fix idempotency for IP addresses for networks. The old implementation checked the effective
   IP addresses assigned by the Docker daemon, and not the specified ones. This causes idempotency issues for
   containers which are not running, since they have no effective IP addresses assigned."
