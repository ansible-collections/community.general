  The ``oc`` connection plugin has been removed from this collection.
  It has been migrated to the `community.okd <https://galaxy.ansible.com/community/okd>`_ collection.
  If you use ansible-base 2.10 or newer, redirections have been provided.

  If you use Ansible 2.9 and installed this collection, you need to adjust the FQCNs (``community.general.oc`` â†’ ``community.okd.oc``) and make sure to install the community.okd collection.

  If you use Ansible 2.9 and the ``oc`` connection plugin from this collections, community.general 2.0.0 results in errors when trying to use the oc content by FQCN, like ``community.general.oc``.
  Since Ansible 2.9 is not able to use redirections, you will have to adjust your inventories, variable files, playbooks and roles manually to use the new FQCN (``community.okd.oc``) and to make sure that you have ``community.okd`` installed.

  If you use ansible-base 2.10 or newer and did not install Ansible 3.0.0, but installed (and/or upgraded) community.general manually, you need to make sure to also install ``community.okd`` if you are using the ``oc`` plugin.
  While ansible-base 2.10 or newer can use the redirects that community.general 2.0.0 adds, the collection they point to (community.okd) must be installed for them to work.
