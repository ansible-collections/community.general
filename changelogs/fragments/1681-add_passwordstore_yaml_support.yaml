breaking_changes:
  - "passwordstore lookup plugin - now parsing a password store entry as YAML if possible, skipping the first line (which by convention only contains the password and nothing else). If it cannot be parsed as YAML, the old ``key: value`` parser will be used to process the entry. Can break backwards compatibility if YAML formatted code was parsed in a non-YAML interpreted way, e.g. ``foo: [bar, baz]`` will become a list with two elements in the new version, but a string ``'[bar, baz]'`` in the old (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/issues/1673)."
