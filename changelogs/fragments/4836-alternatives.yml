bugfixes:
  - "alternatives - only pass subcommands when they are specified as module arguments (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/issues/4803, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/issues/4804, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/4836)."
  - "alternatives - when ``subcommands`` is specified, ``link`` must be given for every subcommand. This was already mentioned in the documentation, but not enforced by the code (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/4836)."
