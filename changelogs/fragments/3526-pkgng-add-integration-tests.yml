bugfixes:
  - 'pkgng - ``name=* state=latest`` check for upgrades did not count "Number of packages to be reinstalled" as a `changed` action, giving incorrect results in both regular and check mode (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/3526).'
  - 'pkgng - an `earlier PR <https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/3393>`_ broke check mode so that the module always reports `not changed`. This is now fixed so that the module reports number of upgrade or install actions that would be performed (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/3526).'
  - 'pkgng - the ``annotation`` functionality was broken and is now fixed, and now also works with check mode (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/3526).'
  - 'pkgng - installing a package from a local (to the target host) file reported failure on success `#3428 <https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/issues/3428>`_
