bugfixes:
  - docker_compose - add a condition to prevent service startup
    if parameter ``stopped`` is true. Otherwise, the service will be
    started on each play and stopped again immediately due to
    the ``stopped`` parameter and breaks the idempotency of the module
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/issues/532).
