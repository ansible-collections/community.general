bugfixes:
  - pulp_repo - the ``client_cert`` and ``client_key`` options were used for both requests to the Pulp instance and for the repo to sync with, resulting in errors when they were used. Use the new options ``feed_client_cert`` and ``feed_client_key`` for client certificates that should only be used for repo synchronisation, and not for communication with the Pulp instance.
