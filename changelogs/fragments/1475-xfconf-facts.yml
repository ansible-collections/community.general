minor_changes:
  - xfconf - added option ``disable_facts`` to disable facts and its associated deprecation warning (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/issues/1475).
deprecated_features:
  - xfconf - returning output as facts is deprecated, this will be removed in community.general 4.0.0. Please register the task output in a variable and use it instead. You can already switch to the new behavior now by using the new ``disable_facts`` option (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/1747).
