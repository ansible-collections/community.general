bugfixes:
  - passwordstore lookup plugin - fix compatibility with gopass when used with
    ``create=true``. While pass returns 1 on a non-existent password, gopass
    returns 10, or 11, depending on whether a similar named password was stored.
    We now just check standard output and that the return code is not zero (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/1589).
