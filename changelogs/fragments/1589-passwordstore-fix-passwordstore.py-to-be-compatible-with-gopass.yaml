bugfixes:
  - passwordstore lookup plugin - fix compatibility with gopass when used with
    ``create=true``. While pass returns 1 on a non-existent password, gopass
    returns 10, or 11, depending on whether a similar named password was stored.
    We know just check stdout and that the return code != 0.
