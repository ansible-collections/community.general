bugfixes:
  - keycloak_user_federation - creating a user federation while specifying an
    ID (that does not exist yet) no longer fail with a 404 Not Found
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/4212).
  - keycloak_user_federation - mappers auto-created by keycloak are matched and
    merged by their name and no longer create duplicated entries
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/4212).
