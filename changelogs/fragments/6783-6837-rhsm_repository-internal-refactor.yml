    rhsm_repository - the interaction with ``subscription-manager`` was
    refactored by grouping things together, removing unused bits, and hardening
    the way it is run; also, the parsing of ``subscription-manager repos --list``
    was improved and made slightly faster; no behaviour change is expected
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/6783,
    https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/6837).
