    xfconf - generating facts was deprecated in community.general 3.0.0,
    however three factoids, ``property``, ``channel`` and ``value`` continued to be generated by mistake.
    This behaviour has been removed and ``xfconf`` generate no facts whatsoever
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/5502).
