minor_changes:
  - filesystem - extend support for FreeBSD. Avoid potential data loss by checking
    existence of a filesystem with ``fstyp`` (native command) if ``blkid`` (foreign
    command) doesn't find one. Add support for character devices and ``ufs`` filesystem
    type (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/2902).
