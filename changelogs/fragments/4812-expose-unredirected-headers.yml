minor_changes:
  - maven_artifact - add a new ``unredirected_headers`` option that can be used with ansible-core 2.12 and above. The default value is to not use ``Authorization`` and ``Cookie`` headers on redirects for security reasons. With ansible-core 2.11, all headers are still passed on for redirects (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/4812).
