bugfixes:
  - bitwarden lookup plugin - the plugin made assumptions about the structure of a Bitwarden JSON object which may have been broken by an update in the Bitwarden API. Remove assumptions, and allow queries for general fields such as ``notes`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/7061).
