deprecated_features:
  - "The next major release, community.general 8.0.0, will drop support for ansible-core 2.11 and 2.12, which have been End of Life for some time
    now. This means that this collection no longer supports Python 2.6 on the target. Individual content might still work with unsupported
    ansible-core versions, but that can change at any time. Also please note that from now on, for every new major community.general release,
    we will drop support for all ansible-core versions that have been End of Life for more than a few weeks on the date of the major release
    (https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/discussions/271, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/7259)."
