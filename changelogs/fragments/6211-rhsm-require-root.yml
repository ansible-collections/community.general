bugfixes:
  - redhat_subscription, rhsm_release, rhsm_repository - cleanly fail when not running as root,
    rather than hanging on an interactive ``console-helper`` prompt; they all interact with
    ``subscription-manager``, which already requires to be run as root
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/issues/734,
     https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/6211).
