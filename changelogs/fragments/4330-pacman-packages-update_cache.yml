bugfixes:
  - "pacman - make sure that ``packages`` is always returned when ``name`` or ``upgrade`` is specified, also if nothing is done
     (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/4329)."
deprecated_features:
  - "pacman - from community.general 5.0.0 on, the ``changed`` status of ``update_cache`` will no longer be ignored if ``name`` or ``upgrade`` is specified.
     To keep the old behavior, add something like ``register: result`` and ``changed_when: result.packages | length > 0`` to your task
     (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/4329)."
