major_changes:
  - The community.general collection no longer supports Ansible 2.9 and ansible-base 2.10. While we take no active measures to prevent usage, we will remove a lot of compatibility code and other compatility measures that will effectively prevent using most content from this collection with Ansible 2.9, and some content of this collection with ansible-base 2.10. Both Ansible 2.9 and ansible-base 2.10 will very soon be End of Life and if you are still using them, you should consider upgrading to ansible-core 2.11 or later as soon as possible (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/4548).

  - path_join filter plugin shim - remove Ansible 2.9 compatibility code (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/4548).
  - archive - remove Ansible 2.9 compatibility code (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/4548).
  - maven_artifact - remove Ansible 2.9 compatibility code (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/4548).

  - java_keystore - remove Ansible 2.9 compatibility code (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/4548).
  - a_module test plugin - remove Ansible 2.9 compatibility code (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/4548).
  - The symbolic links used to implement flatmapping for all modules were removed and replaced by ``meta/runtime.yml`` redirects. This effectively breaks compatibility with Ansible 2.9 for all modules (without using their "long" names, which is discouraged and which can change without previous notice since they are considered an implementation detail) (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/4548).
