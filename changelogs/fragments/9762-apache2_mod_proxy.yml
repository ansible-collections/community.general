bugfixes:
  - "apache2_mod_proxy - make compatible with Python 3 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/9762)."
  - "apache2_mod_proxy - passing the cluster's page as referer for the member's pages. This makes the module actually work again for halfway modern Apache versions.
     According to some comments founds on the net the referer was required since at least 2019 for some versions of Apache 2
     (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/9762)."
