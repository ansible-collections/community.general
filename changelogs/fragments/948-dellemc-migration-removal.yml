  If you use ansible-base 2.10 or newer and did not install Ansible 3.0.0, but installed (and/or upgraded) community.general manually, you need to make sure to also install ``dellemc.openmanage`` if you are using any one of these ``ome_device_info``,  ``idrac_firmware`` or  ``idrac_server_config_profile`` modules.
