minor_changes:
  - haproxy - add options to dis/enable health and agent checks.  When health
    and agent checks are enabled for a service, a disabled service will
    re-enable itself automatically.  These options also change the state of
    the agent checks to match the requested state for the backend
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/issues/684).
