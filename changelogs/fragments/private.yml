deprecated_features:
  - "All module utils, plugin utils, and doc fragments will be made **private** in community.general 13.0.0.
     This means that they will no longer be part of the public API of the collection, and can have breaking
     changes even in bugfix releases. If you depend on importing code from the module or plugin utils,
     or use one of the doc fragments, please
     `comment in the issue to discuss this <https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/issues/11312>`__.
     Note that this does not affect any use of community.general in task files, roles, or playbooks
     (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/issues/11312, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/11320)."
