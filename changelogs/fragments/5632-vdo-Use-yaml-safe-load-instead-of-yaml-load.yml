bugfixes:
  - vdo - now uses ``yaml.safe_load()`` to parse command output instead of the deprecated ``yaml.load()`` which is potentially unsafe. Using ``yaml.load()`` without explicitely setting a ``Loader=`` is also an error in pyYAML 6.0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/5632).
