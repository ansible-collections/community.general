bugfixes:
  - pacman - when the ``update_cache`` option is combined with another option
    such as ``upgrade``, report ``changed`` based on the actions performed by
    the latter option. This was the behavior in community.general 4.4.0 and before.
    In community.general 4.5.0, a task combining these options would always
    report ``changed``
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/4318).

known_issues:
   - pacman - ``update_cache`` cannot differentiate between up to date and
     outdated package lists and will report ``changed`` in both situations
     (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/4318).
