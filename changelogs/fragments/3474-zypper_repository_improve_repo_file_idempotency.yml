bugfixes:
  - zypper_repository - when an URL to a .repo file was provided in option 
    ``repo=`` and ``state=present`` only the first run was successful, 
    future runs failed due to missing checks prior starting zypper.
    Usage of ``state=absent`` in combination with a .repo file was not 
    working either (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/issues/1791,
    https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/issues/3466).
