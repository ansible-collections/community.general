    All ``sap`` modules have been removed from this collection.
    They have been migrated to the `community.sap_libs <https://galaxy.ansible.com/community/sap_libs>`_ collection.
    Redirections have been provided.
    Following modules are affected:
    - sapcar_extract
    - sap_task_list_execute
    - hana_query

    If you are not using this collection as part of Ansible, but installed (and/or upgraded) community.general manually, you need to make sure to also install ``community.sap_libs`` if you are using any of the ``sapcar_extract``, ``sap_task_list_execute``, and ``hana_query`` modules.
    Without that collection installed, the redirects for these modules do not work.
