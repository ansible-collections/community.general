minor_changes:
- "oci_vcn - ``api_user_key_file`` is now of type ``path`` and no longer ``str``. A side effect is that certain expansions are made, like ``~`` is replaced by the user's home directory, and environment variables like ``$HOME`` or ``$TEMP`` are evaluated (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/1741)."
- "lxd_container - ``client_key`` and ``client_cert`` are now of type ``path`` and no longer ``str``. A side effect is that certain expansions are made, like ``~`` is replaced by the user's home directory, and environment variables like ``$HOME`` or ``$TEMP`` are evaluated (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/1741)."
- "lxd_profile - ``client_key`` and ``client_cert`` are now of type ``path`` and no longer ``str``. A side effect is that certain expansions are made, like ``~`` is replaced by the user's home directory, and environment variables like ``$HOME`` or ``$TEMP`` are evaluated (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/1741)."
