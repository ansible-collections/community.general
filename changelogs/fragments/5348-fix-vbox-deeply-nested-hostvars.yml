bugfixes:
  - virtualbox inventory plugin - skip parsing values with keys that have both a value and nested data. Skip parsing values that are nested more than two keys deep (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/issues/5332, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/5348).
