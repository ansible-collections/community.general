  For community.general 2.0.0, the OC connection plugin will be moved to the `community.okd <https://galaxy.ansible.com/community/okd>`_ collection.
  A redirection will be inserted so that users using ansible-base 2.10 or newer do not have to change anything.

  If you use Ansible 2.9 and explicitly use OC connection plugin from this collection, you will need to adjust your playbooks and roles to use FQCNs ``community.okd.oc`` instead of ``community.general.oc``.

  If you use ansible-base and installed ``community.general`` manually and rely on the OC connection plugin, you have to make sure to install the ``community.okd`` collection as well.
  If you are using FQCNs, i.e. ``community.general.oc`` instead of ``oc``, it will continue working, but we still recommend to adjust this FQCN as well.
