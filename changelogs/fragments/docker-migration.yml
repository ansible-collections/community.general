  For community.general 2.0.0, the ``docker`` modules and plugins will be moved to the `community.docker <https://galaxy.ansible.com/community/docker>`_ collection.
  A redirection will be inserted so that users using ansible-base 2.10 or newer do not have to change anything.

  Ansible 2.9 users who explicitly use content from this collection will need to adjust their playbooks and roles to use FQCNs starting with ``community.docker.`` instead of ``community.general.``,
  for example replace ``community.general.docker_container`` in a task by ``community.docker.docker_container``.

  ansible-base users who installed ``community.general`` manually and rely on the docker modules have to make sure to install the ``community.docker`` collection as well.
  If you are using FQCNs, i.e. ``community.general.docker_container`` instead of ``docker_container``, it will continue working, but we still recommend to adjust the FQCNs as well.
