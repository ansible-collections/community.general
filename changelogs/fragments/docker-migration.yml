  For community.general 2.0.0, the ``docker`` modules and plugins will be moved to the `community.docker <https://galaxy.ansible.com/community/docker>`_ collection.
  A redirection will be inserted so that users using ansible-base 2.10 or newer do not have to change anything.

  If you use Ansible 2.9 and explicitly use ``docker`` content from this collection, you will need to adjust your playbooks and roles to use FQCNs starting with ``community.docker.`` instead of ``community.general.``,
  for example replace ``community.general.docker_container`` in a task by ``community.docker.docker_container``.

  If you use ansible-base and installed ``community.general`` manually and rely on the ``docker`` content, you have to make sure to install the ``community.docker`` collection as well.
  If you are using FQCNs, i.e. ``community.general.docker_container`` instead of ``docker_container``, it will continue working, but we still recommend to adjust the FQCNs as well.
