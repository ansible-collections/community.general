minor_changes:
  - pkgng - packages being installed (or upgraded) are acted on in one command (per action)
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/issues/2265).
  - pkgng - status message specifies number of packages installed and/or upgraded separately.
    Previously, all changes were reported as one count of packages "added" (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/3393).
