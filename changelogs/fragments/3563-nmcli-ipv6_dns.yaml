bugfixes:
  - nmcli - fixed ``dns6`` option handling so that it is treated as a list internally (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/3563).
  - nmcli - fixed ``ipv4.route-metric`` being in properties of type list (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/3563).
