minor_changes:
  - listen_ports_facts - add new ``include_non_listening`` option which adds ``-a`` option to ``netstat`` and ``ss``. This shows both listening and non-listening (for TCP this means established connections) sockets, and returns ``state`` and ``foreign_address`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/issues/4762, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/4953).
