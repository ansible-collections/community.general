    ModuleHelper module utils - when the module sets output variables named ``msg``, ``exception``, ``output``, ``vars``, or ``changed``,
    the actual output will prefix those names with ``_`` (underscore symbol) only when they clash with output variables generated by ModuleHelper
    itself, which only occurs when handling exceptions. Please note that this breaking
    change does not require a new major release since before this release, it was not possible
    to add such variables to the output
    `due to a bug <https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/5755>`__
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/5765).
