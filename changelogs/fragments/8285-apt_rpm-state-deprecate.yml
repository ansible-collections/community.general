deprecated_features:
  - "apt_rpm - the behavior of ``state=present`` and ``state=installed`` is deprecated and will change in community.general 11.0.0.
     Right now the module will upgrade a package to the latest version if one of these two states is used. You should explicitly
     use ``state=latest`` if you want this behavior, and switch to ``state=present_not_latest`` if you do not want to upgrade the
     package if it is already installed. In community.general 11.0.0 the behavior of ``state=present`` and ``state=installed`` will
     change to that of ``state=present_not_latest`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/issues/8217,
     https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/8285)."
