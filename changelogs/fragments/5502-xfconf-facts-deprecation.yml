    xfconf - generating facts was deprecated in the commit
    https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/commit/af64c9a432417b6694ae936fb5566fcfba763786,
    however two factoids, ``previous_value`` and ``type`` continued to be generated by mistake. This behaviour
    has been removed and ``xfconf`` generate no facts whatsoever
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/5502).
