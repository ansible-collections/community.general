    xfconf - generating facts was deprecated in community.general 3.0.0,
    however two factoids, ``previous_value`` and ``type`` continued to be generated by mistake. This behaviour
    has been removed and ``xfconf`` generate no facts whatsoever
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/5502).
