minor_changes:
  - jenkins_build - add new ``detach`` option, which allows the module to exit successfully as long as the build is created (default functionality is still waiting for the build to end before exiting) (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/7204).
  - jenkins_build - add new ``time_between_checks`` option, which allows to configure the wait time between requests to the Jenkins server (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/7204).
