minor_changes:
- "grove - the option ``message`` has been renamed to ``message_content``. The old name ``message`` is kept as an alias and will be removed for community.general 4.0.0. This was done because ``message`` is used internally by Ansible (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/1929)."
deprecated_features:
- "grove - the option ``message`` will be removed in community.general 4.0.0. Use the new option ``message_content`` instead (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/1929)."
