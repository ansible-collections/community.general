minor_changes:
  - telegram - now can call any methods in Telegram bot API.
    Previously this module was hardcoded to use "SendMessage" only.
    Usage of "SendMessage" API method was also librated,
    and now you can specify any arguments you need, for example, "disable_notificaton" (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/1642).
