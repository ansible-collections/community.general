minor_changes:
  - gitlab_runner - add new boolean option ``access_level_on_creation``. It controls, whether the value of ``access_level`` is used for runner registration or not. The option ``access_level`` has been ignored on registration so far and was only used on updates (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/issues/5907, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/5908).
deprecated_features:
  - gitlab_runner - the default of the new option ``access_level_on_creation`` will change from ``false`` to ``true`` in community.general 7.0.0. This will cause ``access_level`` to be used during runner registration as well, and not only during updates (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/5908).
