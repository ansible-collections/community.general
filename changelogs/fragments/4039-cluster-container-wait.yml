minor_changes:
  - "lxc_container module - adds wait_for_container parameter to the lxc_container module. This is a bool true or false. If true it will wait till the running task reports success as the status. Defaults to false. Not required."
bugfixes:
  - "lxd inventory plugin, lxd_container module, lxd_profile module - adds a wait period (if specified in wait_for_container) when creating clustered containers for when the task is still running and not immediately jump to success. This would error out when the task was still running (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/4039)."
