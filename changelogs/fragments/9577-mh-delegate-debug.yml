minor_changes:
  - MH module utils - delegate ``debug`` to the underlying ``AnsibleModule`` instance or issues a warning if an attribute already exists with that name (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/9577).
deprecated_features:
  - >
    MH module utils - attribute ``debug`` definition in subclasses of MH is now deprecated, as that name will become a delegation to ``AnsibleModule`` in
    community.general 12.0.0, and any such attribute will be overridden by that delegation in that version (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/9577).
