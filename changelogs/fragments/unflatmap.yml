major_changes:
  - "The internal structure of the collection was changed for modules and action plugins.
     These no longer live in a directory hierarchy ordered by topic, but instead are now all in a single (flat) directory.
     This has no impact on users *assuming they did not use internal FQCNs*. These will still work, but result in deprecation warnings.
     They were never officially supported and thus the redirects are kept as a courtsey, and this is not labelled as a breaking change.
     Note that for example the Ansible VScode plugin started recommending these internal names. If you followed its recommendation,
     you will now have to change back to the short names to avoid deprecation warnings, and potential errors in the future as
     these redirects will be removed in community.general 9.0.0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/5461)."
