bugfixes:
  - "slack - fix message update for channels which start with a prefix not in the hardcoded list, for example ``G4``. When ``message-id`` was passed it failed for channels which started with ``G4`` because the ``#`` symbol was added before the ``channel_id``. Adding a prepend_hash option to workaround this issue for channel id prefixes not in the list. There are three-value options:``prepend_hash: always | never | auto``, with current default auto to maintain current behavior (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/5629)."
