    All Google cloud modules and plugins have now been migrated away from this collection.
    They can be found in either the `community.google <https://galaxy.ansible.com/community/google>`_ or `google.cloud <https://galaxy.ansible.com/google/cloud>`_ collections.
    If you use ansible-base 2.10 or newer, redirections have been provided.
    
    If you use Ansible 2.9 and installed this collection, you need to adjust the FQCNs (``community.general.gce_img`` â†’ ``community.google.gce_img``) and make sure to install the community.google or google.cloud collections as appropriate.
  - The Google cloud inventory script ``gce.py`` has been migrated to the ``community.google`` collection. Install the ``community.google`` collection in order to continue using it.

    If you use Ansible 2.9 and the Google cloud plugins or modules from this collection, community.general 2.0.0 results in errors when trying to use the Google cloud content by FQCN, like ``community.general.gce_img``.
    Since Ansible 2.9 is not able to use redirections, you will have to adjust your playbooks and roles manually to use the new FQCNs (``community.google.gce_img`` for the previous example) and to make sure that you have ``community.google`` installed.
    
    If you use ansible-base 2.10 or newer and did not install Ansible 3.0.0, but installed (and/or upgraded) community.general manually, you need to make sure to also install the ``community.google`` or ``google.cloud`` collections if you are using any of the Google cloud plugins or modules.
    While ansible-base 2.10 or newer can use the redirects that community.general 2.0.0 adds, the collection they point to (such as community.google) must be installed for them to work.
  - The Google cloud inventory script ``gce.py`` has been migrated to the ``community.google`` collection. Install the ``community.google`` collection in order to continue using it.
