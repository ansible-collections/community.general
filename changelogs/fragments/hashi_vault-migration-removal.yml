  The ``hashi_vault`` lookup plugin has been removed from this collection.
  It has been migrated to the `community.hashi_vault <https://galaxy.ansible.com/community/hashi_vault>`_ collection.
  If you use ansible-base 2.10 or newer, redirections have been provided.

  If you use Ansible 2.9 and installed this collection, you need to adjust the FQCNs (``community.general.hashi_vault`` â†’ ``community.hashi_vault.hashi_vault``) and make sure to install the community.hashi_vault collection.

  If you use Ansible 2.9 and the ``hashi_vault`` lookup plugin from this collections, community.general 2.0.0 results in errors when trying to use the Hashi Vault content by FQCN, like ``community.general.hashi_vault``.
  Since Ansible 2.9 is not able to use redirections, you will have to adjust your inventories, variable files, playbooks and roles manually to use the new FQCN (``community.hashi_vault.hashi_vault``) and to make sure that you have ``community.hashi_vault`` installed.

  If you use ansible-base 2.10 or newer and did not install Ansible 3.0.0, but installed (and/or upgraded) community.general manually, you need to make sure to also install ``community.hashi_vault`` if you are using the ``hashi_vault`` plugin.
  While ansible-base 2.10 or newer can use the redirects that community.general 2.0.0 adds, the collection they point to (community.hashi_vault) must be installed for them to work.
