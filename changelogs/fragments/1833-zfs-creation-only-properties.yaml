bugfixes:
  - zfs - some ZFS properties could be passed when the dataset/volume did not exist, but would fail if the dataset already existed, even if the property matched what was specified in the ansible task (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/issues/868, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/1833).
