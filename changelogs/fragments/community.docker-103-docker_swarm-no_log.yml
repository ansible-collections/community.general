security_fixes:
- "docker_swarm - the ``join_token`` option is now marked as ``no_log`` so it is no longer written into logs (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/103)."
breaking_changes:
- "docker_swarm - if ``join_token`` is specified, a returned join token with the same value will be replaced by ``VALUE_SPECIFIED_IN_NO_LOG_PARAMETER``. Make sure that you do not blindly use the join tokens from the return value of this module when the module is invoked with ``join_token`` specified! This breaking change appears in a minor release since it is necessary to fix a security issue (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/103)."
