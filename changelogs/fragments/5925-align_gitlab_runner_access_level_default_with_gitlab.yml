deprecated_features:
  - gitlab_runner - the option ``access_level`` will lose its default value in community.general 8.0.0. From that version on, you have set this option to ``ref_protected`` explicitly, if you want to have a protected runner (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/issues/5925).
