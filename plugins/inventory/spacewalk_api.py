# notes:
# Tested on Spacewalk v2.10, v2.9, and Ansible v2.8.1
# This is a dynamic inventory script that uses the Spacewalk API as a source
# Spacewalk won't be developed much more, at least by Redhat, but
# if you have a spacewalk server for patches, you may like to keep it around
# Often, the servers you patch are the ones you need to know about, thus
# this inventory gives you a decent source of truth if you don't have a CMDB
# The only thing you should need are the three ENV vars and then run the script
