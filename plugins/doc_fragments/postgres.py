notes:
- The default authentication assumes that you are either logging in as or sudo'ing to the C(postgres) account on the host.
- To avoid "Peer authentication failed for user postgres" error,
  use postgres user as a I(become_user).
- This module uses psycopg2, a Python PostgreSQL database adapter. You must
  ensure that psycopg2 is installed on the host before using this module.
- If the remote host is the PostgreSQL server (which is the default case), then
  PostgreSQL must also be installed on the remote host.
- For Ubuntu-based systems, install the postgresql, libpq-dev, and python-psycopg2 packages
  on the remote host before using this module.
- The ca_cert parameter requires at least Postgres version 8.4 and I(psycopg2) version 2.4.3.
