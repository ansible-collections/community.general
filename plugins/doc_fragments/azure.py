              access to more than one subscription, otherwise the first subscription is chosen.

requirements:
    - python >= 2.7
    - azure >= 2.0.0

notes:
    - For authentication with Azure you can pass parameters, set environment variables, use a profile stored
      in ~/.azure/credentials, or log in before you run your tasks or playbook with C(az login).
    - Authentication is also possible using a service principal or Active Directory user.
    - To authenticate via service principal, pass subscription_id, client_id, secret and tenant or set environment
      variables AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_SECRET and AZURE_TENANT.
    - To authenticate via Active Directory user, pass ad_user and password, or set AZURE_AD_USER and
      AZURE_PASSWORD in the environment.
    - "Alternatively, credentials can be stored in ~/.azure/credentials. This is an ini file containing
      a [default] section and the following keys: subscription_id, client_id, secret and tenant or
      subscription_id, ad_user and password. It is also possible to add additional profiles. Specify the profile
      by passing profile or setting AZURE_PROFILE in the environment."
