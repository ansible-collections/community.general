module: win_user_profile
short_description: Manages the Windows user profiles.
description:
- Used to create or remove user profiles on a Windows host.
- This can be used to create a profile before a user logs on or delete a
  profile when removing a user account.
- A profile can be created for both a local or domain account.
options:
  name:
    description:
    - Specifies the base name for the profile path.
    - When I(state) is C(present) this is used to create the profile for
      I(username) at a specific path within the profile directory.
    - This cannot be used to specify a path outside of the profile directory
      but rather it specifies a folder(s) within this directory.
    - If a profile for another user already exists at the same path, then a 3
      digit incremental number is appended by Windows automatically.
    - When I(state) is C(absent) and I(username) is not set, then the module
      will remove all profiles that point to the profile path derived by this
      value.
    - This is useful if the account no longer exists but the profile still
      remains.
    type: str
  remove_multiple:
    description:
    - When I(state) is C(absent) and the value for I(name) matches multiple
      profiles the module will fail.
    - Set this value to C(yes) to force the module to delete all the profiles
      found.
    default: no
    type: bool
  state:
    description:
    - Will ensure the profile exists when set to C(present).
    - When creating a profile the I(username) option must be set to a valid
      account.
    - Will remove the profile(s) when set to C(absent).
    - When removing a profile either I(username) must be set to a valid
      account, or I(name) is set to the profile's base name.
    default: present
    choices:
    - absent
    - present
    type: str
  username:
    description:
    - The account name of security identifier (SID) for the profile.
    - This must be set when I(state) is C(present) and must be a valid account
      or the SID of a valid account.
    - When I(state) is C(absent) then this must still be a valid account number
      but the SID can be a deleted user's SID.
