      services in this list.
    type: list
  dependency_action:
    description:
    - Used in conjunction with C(dependency) to either add the dependencies to
      the existing service dependencies.
    - Remove the dependencies to the existing dependencies.
    - Set the dependencies to only the values in the list replacing the
      existing dependencies.

    choices: [ add, remove, set ]
    default: set
  desktop_interact:
    description:

    - If C(no), stopping or restarting a service with dependent services may
      fail.
    type: bool
    default: no
  name:
    description:
    - Name of the service.
    - If only the name parameter is specified, the module will report
      on whether the service exists or not without making any changes.
    required: yes
    type: str
  path:
    description:
    - The path to the executable to set for the service.
    type: str
  password:
    description:
    - The password to set the service to start as.
    - This and the C(username) argument must be supplied together.
    - If specifying C(LocalSystem), C(NetworkService) or C(LocalService) this field
      must be an empty string and not null.
    type: str
  start_mode:
    description:
    - Set the startup type for the service.
    - A newly created service will default to C(auto).

    choices: [ auto, delayed, disabled, manual ]
  state:
    description:
    - The desired state of the service.
    - C(started)/C(stopped)/C(absent)/C(paused) are idempotent actions that will not run
      commands unless necessary.
    - C(restarted) will always bounce the service.
    - C(absent) was added in Ansible 2.3
    - C(paused) was added in Ansible 2.4
    - Only services that support the paused state can be paused, you can
      check the return value C(can_pause_and_continue).
    - You can only pause a service that is already started.
    - A newly created service will default to C(stopped).
    type: str
    choices: [ absent, paused, started, stopped, restarted ]
  username:
    description:
    - The username to set the service to start as.
    - This and the C(password) argument must be supplied together when using
      a local or domain account.
    - Set to C(LocalSystem) to use the SYSTEM account.
    - A newly created service will default to C(LocalSystem).
    - If using a custom user account, it must have the C(SeServiceLogonRight)
      granted to be able to start up. You can use the M(win_user_right) module
      to grant this user right for you.
