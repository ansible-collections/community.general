module: win_get_url
short_description: Downloads file from HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP to node
description:
- Downloads files from HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP to the remote server.
- The remote server I(must) have direct access to the remote resource.
- For non-Windows targets, use the M(get_url) module instead.
options:
  url:
    description:
    - The full URL of a file to download.
    type: str
    required: yes
  dest:
    description:
    - The location to save the file at the URL.
    - Be sure to include a filename and extension as appropriate.
    type: path
    required: yes
  force:
    description:
    - If C(yes), will download the file every time and replace the file if the contents change. If C(no), will only
      download the file if it does not exist or the remote file has been
      modified more recently than the local file.
    - This works by sending an http HEAD request to retrieve last modified
      time of the requested resource, so for this to work, the remote web
      server must support HEAD requests.
    type: bool
    default: yes
  checksum:
    description:
      - If a I(checksum) is passed to this parameter, the digest of the
        destination file will be calculated after it is downloaded to ensure
        its integrity and verify that the transfer completed successfully.
      - This option cannot be set with I(checksum_url).
    type: str
  checksum_algorithm:
    description:
      - Specifies the hashing algorithm used when calculating the checksum of
        the remote and destination file.
    type: str
    choices:
      - md5
      - sha1
      - sha256
      - sha384
      - sha512
    default: sha1
  checksum_url:
    description:
      - Specifies a URL that contains the checksum values for the resource at
        I(url).
      - Like C(checksum), this is used to verify the integrity of the remote
        transfer.
      - This option cannot be set with I(checksum).
    type: str
  url_username:
    description:
    - The username to use for authentication.
    - The aliases I(user) and I(username) are deprecated and will be removed in
      Ansible 2.14.
    aliases:
    - user
    - username
  url_password:
    description:
    - The password for I(url_username).
    - The alias I(password) is deprecated and will be removed in Ansible 2.14.
    aliases:
    - password
  proxy_url:
  proxy_username:
  proxy_password:
  headers:
  use_proxy:
  follow_redirects:
  maximum_redirection:
  client_cert:
  client_cert_password:
  method:
    description:
    - This option is not for use with C(win_get_url) and should be ignored.
notes:
- If your URL includes an escaped slash character (%2F) this module will convert it to a real slash.
  This is a result of the behaviour of the System.Uri class as described in
  L(the documentation,https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/network/schemesettings-element-uri-settings#remarks).
- Since Ansible 2.8, the module will skip reporting a change if the remote
  checksum is the same as the local local even when C(force=yes). This is to
  better align with M(get_url).
