module: win_file
short_description: Creates, touches or removes files or directories
description:
     - Creates (empty) files, updates file modification stamps of existing files,
       and can create or remove directories.
     - Unlike M(file), does not modify ownership, permissions or manipulate links.
     - For non-Windows targets, use the M(file) module instead.
options:
  path:
    description:
      - Path to the file being managed.
    required: yes
    type: path
    aliases: [ dest, name ]
  state:
    description:
      - If C(directory), all immediate subdirectories will be created if they
        do not exist.
      - If C(file), the file will NOT be created if it does not exist, see the M(copy)
        or M(template) module if you want that behavior.  If C(absent),
        directories will be recursively deleted, and files will be removed.
      - If C(touch), an empty file will be created if the C(path) does not
        exist, while an existing file or directory will receive updated file access and
        modification times (similar to the way C(touch) works from the command line).
