module: win_domain
short_description: Ensures the existence of a Windows domain
description:
- Ensure that the domain named by C(dns_domain_name) exists and is reachable.
- If the domain is not reachable, the domain is created in a new forest on the target Windows Server 2012R2+ host.
- This module may require subsequent use of the M(win_reboot) action if changes are made.
options:
  dns_domain_name:
    description:
    - The DNS name of the domain which should exist and be reachable or reside on the target Windows host.
    type: str
    required: yes
  domain_netbios_name:
    description:
    - The NetBIOS name for the root domain in the new forest.
    - For NetBIOS names to be valid for use with this parameter they must be single label names of 15 characters or less, if not it will fail.
    - If this parameter is not set, then the default is automatically computed from the value of the I(domain_name) parameter.
    type: str
  safe_mode_password:
    description:
    - Safe mode password for the domain controller.
    type: str
    required: yes
  database_path:
    description:
    - The path to a directory on a fixed disk of the Windows host where the
      domain database will be created.
    - If not set then the default path is C(%SYSTEMROOT%\NTDS).

  create_dns_delegation:
    description:
    - Whether to create a DNS delegation that references the new DNS server that you install along with the domain controller.
    - Valid for Active Directory-integrated DNS only.
    - The default is computed automatically based on the environment.
    type: bool
  domain_mode:
    description:
    - Specifies the domain functional level of the first domain in the creation of a new forest.
    - The domain functional level cannot be lower than the forest functional level, but it can be higher.
    - The default is automatically computed and set.
    type: str
    choices: [ Win2003, Win2008, Win2008R2, Win2012, Win2012R2, WinThreshold ]
  forest_mode:
