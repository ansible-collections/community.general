options:
  backup:
    description:
    - Determine whether a backup should be created.
    - When set to C(yes), create a backup file including the timestamp information
      so you can get the original file back if you somehow clobbered it incorrectly.
    type: bool
    default: no
  newline_sequence:
    default: '\r\n'
  force:
notes:
- Beware fetching files from windows machines when creating templates because certain tools, such as Powershell ISE,
  and regedit's export facility add a Byte Order Mark as the first character of the file, which can cause tracebacks.
- You can use the M(win_copy) module with the C(content:) option if you prefer the template inline, as part of the
  playbook.
- For Linux you can use M(template) which uses '\\n' as C(newline_sequence) by default.
