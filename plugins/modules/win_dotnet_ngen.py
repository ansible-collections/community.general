module: win_dotnet_ngen
short_description: Runs ngen to recompile DLLs after .NET  updates
description:
    - After .NET framework is installed/updated, Windows will probably want to recompile things to optimise for the host.
    - This happens via scheduled task, usually at some inopportune time.
    - This module allows you to run this task on your own schedule, so you incur the CPU hit at some more convenient and controlled time.
    - U(https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/tools/ngen-exe-native-image-generator#native-image-service)

options: {}
notes:
    - There are in fact two scheduled tasks for ngen but they have no triggers so aren't a problem.
    - There's no way to test if they've been completed.
    - The stdout is quite likely to be several megabytes.
