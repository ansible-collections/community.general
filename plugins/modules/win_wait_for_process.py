module: win_wait_for_process
short_description: Waits for a process to exist or not exist before continuing.
description:
- Waiting for a process to start or stop.
- This is useful when Windows services behave poorly and do not enumerate external dependencies in their manifest.
options:
  process_name_exact:
    description:
    - The name of the process(es) for which to wait.  The name of the process(es) should not include the file extension suffix.
    type: list
  process_name_pattern:
    description:
    - RegEx pattern matching desired process(es).
    type: str
  sleep:
    description:
    - Number of seconds to sleep between checks.
    - Only applies when waiting for a process to start.  Waiting for a process to start
      does not have a native non-polling mechanism. Waiting for a stop uses native PowerShell
      and does not require polling.
    type: int
    default: 1
  process_min_count:
    description:
      - Minimum number of process matching the supplied pattern to satisfy C(present) condition.
      - Only applies to C(present).
    type: int
    default: 1
  pid:
    description:
    - The PID of the process.
    type: int
  owner:
    description:
    - The owner of the process.
    - Requires PowerShell version 4.0 or newer.
    type: str
  pre_wait_delay:
    description:
    - Seconds to wait before checking processes.
    type: int
    default: 0
  post_wait_delay:
    description:
    - Seconds to wait after checking for processes.
    type: int
    default: 0
  state:
    description:
    - When checking for a running process C(present) will block execution
      until the process exists, or until the timeout has been reached.
      C(absent) will block execution until the process no longer exists,
      or until the timeout has been reached.
    - When waiting for C(present), the module will return changed only if
      the process was not present on the initial check but became present on
      subsequent checks.
    - If, while waiting for C(absent), new processes matching the supplied
      pattern are started, these new processes will not be included in the
      action.
    type: str
    default: present
    choices: [ absent, present ]
  timeout:
    description:
    - The maximum number of seconds to wait for a for a process to start or stop
      before erroring out.
    type: int
    default: 300
