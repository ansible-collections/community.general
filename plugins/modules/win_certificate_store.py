module: win_certificate_store
short_description: Manages the certificate store
description:
- Used to import/export and remove certificates and keys from the local
  certificate store.
- This module is not used to create certificates and will only manage existing
  certs as a file or in the store.
- It can be used to import PEM, DER, P7B, PKCS12 (PFX) certificates and export
  PEM, DER and PKCS12 certificates.
options:
  state:
    description:
    - If C(present), will ensure that the certificate at I(path) is imported
      into the certificate store specified.
    - If C(absent), will ensure that the certificate specified by I(thumbprint)
      or the thumbprint of the cert at I(path) is removed from the store
      specified.
    - If C(exported), will ensure the file at I(path) is a certificate
      specified by I(thumbprint).
    - When exporting a certificate, if I(path) is a directory then the module
      will fail, otherwise the file will be replaced if needed.
    type: str
    choices: [ absent, exported, present ]
    default: present
  path:
    description:
    - The path to a certificate file.
    - This is required when I(state) is C(present) or C(exported).
    - When I(state) is C(absent) and I(thumbprint) is not specified, the
      thumbprint is derived from the certificate at this path.
    type: path
  thumbprint:
    description:
    - The thumbprint as a hex string to either export or remove.
    - See the examples for how to specify the thumbprint.
    type: str
  store_name:
    description:
    - The store name to use when importing a certificate or searching for a
      certificate.
    - "C(AddressBook): The X.509 certificate store for other users"
    - "C(AuthRoot): The X.509 certificate store for third-party certificate authorities (CAs)"
    - "C(CertificateAuthority): The X.509 certificate store for intermediate certificate authorities (CAs)"
    - "C(Disallowed): The X.509 certificate store for revoked certificates"
    - "C(My): The X.509 certificate store for personal certificates"
    - "C(Root): The X.509 certificate store for trusted root certificate authorities (CAs)"
    - "C(TrustedPeople): The X.509 certificate store for directly trusted people and resources"
    - "C(TrustedPublisher): The X.509 certificate store for directly trusted publishers"
    type: str
    choices:
    - AddressBook
    - AuthRoot
    - CertificateAuthority
    - Disallowed
    - My
    - Root
    - TrustedPeople
    - TrustedPublisher
    default: My
  store_location:
    description:
    - The store location to use when importing a certificate or searching for a
      certificate.
    choices: [ CurrentUser, LocalMachine ]
    default: LocalMachine
  password:
    description:
    - The password of the pkcs12 certificate key.
    - This is used when reading a pkcs12 certificate file or the password to
      set when C(state=exported) and C(file_type=pkcs12).
    - If the pkcs12 file has no password set or no password should be set on
      the exported file, do not set this option.
    type: str
  key_exportable:
    description:
    - Whether to allow the private key to be exported.
    - If C(no), then this module and other process will only be able to export
      the certificate and the private key cannot be exported.
    - Used when C(state=present) only.
    type: bool
    default: yes
  key_storage:
    description:
    - Specifies where Windows will store the private key when it is imported.
    - When set to C(default), the default option as set by Windows is used, typically C(user).
    - When set to C(machine), the key is stored in a path accessible by various
      users.
    - When set to C(user), the key is stored in a path only accessible by the
      current user.
    - Used when C(state=present) only and cannot be changed once imported.
    - See U(https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.security.cryptography.x509certificates.x509keystorageflags.aspx)
      for more details.
    type: str
    choices: [ default, machine, user ]
    default: default
  file_type:
    description:
    - The file type to export the certificate as when C(state=exported).
    - C(der) is a binary ASN.1 encoded file.
    - C(pem) is a base64 encoded file of a der file in the OpenSSL form.
    - C(pkcs12) (also known as pfx) is a binary container that contains both
      the certificate and private key unlike the other options.
    - When C(pkcs12) is set and the private key is not exportable or accessible
      by the current user, it will throw an exception.
    type: str
    choices: [ der, pem, pkcs12 ]
    default: der
notes:
- Some actions on PKCS12 certificates and keys may fail with the error
  C(the specified network password is not correct), either use CredSSP or
  Kerberos with credential delegation, or use C(become) to bypass these
  restrictions.
- The certificates must be located on the Windows host to be set with I(path).
- When importing a certificate for usage in IIS, it is generally required
  to use the C(machine) key_storage option, as both C(default) and C(user)
  will make the private key unreadable to IIS APPPOOL identities and prevent
  binding the certificate to the https endpoint.
