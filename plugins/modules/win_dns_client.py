module: win_dns_client
short_description: Configures DNS lookup on Windows hosts
description:
  - The C(win_dns_client) module configures the DNS client on Windows network adapters.
options:
  adapter_names:
    description:
      - Adapter name or list of adapter names for which to manage DNS settings ('*' is supported as a wildcard value).
      - The adapter name used is the connection caption in the Network Control Panel or the InterfaceAlias of C(Get-DnsClientServerAddress).
    type: list
    required: yes
  dns_servers:
    description:
      - Single or ordered list of DNS servers (IPv4 and IPv6 addresses) to configure for lookup. An empty list will configure the adapter to use the
        DHCP-assigned values on connections where DHCP is enabled, or disable DNS lookup on statically-configured connections.
      - IPv6 DNS servers can only be set on Windows Server 2012 or newer, older hosts can only set IPv4 addresses.
      - Before 2.10 use ipv4_addresses instead.
    type: list
    required: yes
    aliases: [ "ipv4_addresses", "ip_addresses", "addresses" ]
notes:
  - When setting an empty list of DNS server addresses on an adapter with DHCP enabled, a change will always be registered, since it is not possible to
    detect the difference between a DHCP-sourced server value and one that is statically set.
