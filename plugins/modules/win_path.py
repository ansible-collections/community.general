module: win_path
short_description: Manage Windows path environment variables
description:
    - Allows element-based ordering, addition, and removal of Windows path environment variables.
options:
  name:
    description:
      - Target path environment variable name.
    type: str
    default: PATH
  elements:
    description:
      - A single path element, or a list of path elements (ie, directories) to add or remove.
      - When multiple elements are included in the list (and C(state) is C(present)), the elements are guaranteed to appear in the same relative order
        in the resultant path value.
      - Variable expansions (eg, C(%VARNAME%)) are allowed, and are stored unexpanded in the target path element.
      - Any existing path elements not mentioned in C(elements) are always preserved in their current order.
      - New path elements are appended to the path, and existing path elements may be moved closer to the end to satisfy the requested ordering.
      - Paths are compared in a case-insensitive fashion, and trailing backslashes are ignored for comparison purposes. However, note that trailing
        backslashes in YAML require quotes.
    type: list
    required: yes
  state:
    description:
      - Whether the path elements specified in C(elements) should be present or absent.
    type: str
    choices: [ absent, present ]
  scope:
    description:
      - The level at which the environment variable specified by C(name) should be managed (either for the current user or global machine scope).
    type: str
    choices: [ machine, user ]
    default: machine
notes:
   - This module is for modifying individual elements of path-like
     environment variables. For general-purpose management of other
     environment vars, use the M(win_environment) module.
   - This module does not broadcast change events.
     This means that the minority of windows applications which can have
     their environment changed without restarting will not be notified and
     therefore will need restarting to pick up new environment settings.
   - User level environment variables will require an interactive user to
     log out and in again before they become available.
