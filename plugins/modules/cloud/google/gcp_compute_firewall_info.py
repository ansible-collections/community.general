        The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically,
        the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression `[a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?`
        which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following

      description:
      - Priority for this rule. This is an integer between 0 and 65535, both inclusive.
        When not specified, the value assumed is 1000. Relative priorities determine
        precedence of conflicting rules. Lower value of priority implies higher precedence
        (eg, a rule with priority 0 has higher precedence than a rule with priority
        1). DENY rules take precedence over ALLOW rules having equal priority.
      returned: success
      type: int
    sourceRanges:
      description:
      - If source ranges are specified, the firewall will apply only to traffic that
        has source IP address in these ranges. These ranges must be expressed in CIDR
        format. One or both of sourceRanges and sourceTags may be set. If both properties
        are set, the firewall will apply to traffic that has source IP address within
        sourceRanges OR the source IP that belongs to a tag listed in the sourceTags
        property. The connection does not need to match both properties for the firewall
        to apply. Only IPv4 is supported.
      returned: success
      type: list
    sourceServiceAccounts:
      description:
      - If source service accounts are specified, the firewall will apply only to
        traffic originating from an instance with a service account in this list.
        Source service accounts cannot be used to control traffic to an instance's
        external IP address because service accounts are associated with an instance,
        not an IP address. sourceRanges can be set at the same time as sourceServiceAccounts.
        If both are set, the firewall will apply to traffic that has source IP address
        within sourceRanges OR the source IP belongs to an instance with service account
        listed in sourceServiceAccount. The connection does not need to match both
        properties for the firewall to apply. sourceServiceAccounts cannot be used
        at the same time as sourceTags or targetTags.
      returned: success
      type: list
    sourceTags:
      description:
      - If source tags are specified, the firewall will apply only to traffic with
        source IP that belongs to a tag listed in source tags. Source tags cannot
        be used to control traffic to an instance's external IP address. Because tags
        are associated with an instance, not an IP address. One or both of sourceRanges
        and sourceTags may be set. If both properties are set, the firewall will apply
        to traffic that has source IP address within sourceRanges OR the source IP
        that belongs to a tag listed in the sourceTags property. The connection does
        not need to match both properties for the firewall to apply.
      returned: success
      type: list
    targetServiceAccounts:
      description:
      - A list of service accounts indicating sets of instances located in the network
        that may make network connections as specified in allowed[].
      - targetServiceAccounts cannot be used at the same time as targetTags or sourceTags.
        If neither targetServiceAccounts nor targetTags are specified, the firewall
        rule applies to all instances on the specified network.
      returned: success
      type: list
    targetTags:
      description:
      - A list of instance tags indicating sets of instances located in the network
        that may make network connections as specified in allowed[].
      - If no targetTags are specified, the firewall rule applies to all instances
        on the specified network.
