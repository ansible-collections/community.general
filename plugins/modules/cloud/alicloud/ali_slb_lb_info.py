      - Use a load balancer name prefix to filter load balancers.
    type: str
  filters:
    description:
      - A dict of filters to apply. Each dict item consists of a filter key and a filter value. The filter keys can be
        all of request parameters. See U(https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/27582.htm) for parameter details.
        Filter keys can be same as request parameter name or be lower case and use underscores ("_") or dashes ("-") to
        connect different words in one parameter. 'LoadBalancerId' will be appended to I(load_balancer_ids) automatically.
