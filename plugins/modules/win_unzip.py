module: win_unzip
short_description: Unzips compressed files and archives on the Windows node
description:
- Unzips compressed files and archives.
- Supports .zip files natively.
- Supports other formats supported by the Powershell Community Extensions (PSCX) module (basically everything 7zip supports).
- For non-Windows targets, use the M(unarchive) module instead.
requirements:
- PSCX
options:
  src:
    description:
      - File to be unzipped (provide absolute path).
    type: path
    required: yes
  dest:
    description:
      - Destination of zip file (provide absolute path of directory). If it does not exist, the directory will be created.
    type: path
    required: yes
  delete_archive:
    description:
      - Remove the zip file, after unzipping.
    type: bool
    default: no
    aliases: [ rm ]
  recurse:
    description:
      - Recursively expand zipped files within the src file.
      - Setting to a value of C(yes) requires the PSCX module to be installed.
    type: bool
    default: no
  creates:
    description:
      - If this file or directory exists the specified src will not be extracted.
    type: path
notes:
- This module is not really idempotent, it will extract the archive every time, and report a change.
- For extracting any compression types other than .zip, the PowerShellCommunityExtensions (PSCX) Module is required.  This module (in conjunction with PSCX)
  has the ability to recursively unzip files within the src zip file provided and also functionality for many other compression types. If the destination
  directory does not exist, it will be created before unzipping the file.  Specifying rm parameter will force removal of the src file after extraction.
