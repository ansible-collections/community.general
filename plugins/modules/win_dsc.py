module: win_dsc
short_description: Invokes a PowerShell DSC configuration
description:
- Configures a resource using PowerShell DSC.
- Requires PowerShell version 5.0 or newer.
- Most of the options for this module are dynamic and will vary depending on
  the DSC Resource specified in I(resource_name).
- See :doc:`/user_guide/windows_dsc` for more information on how to use this module.
options:
  resource_name:
    description:
    - The name of the DSC Resource to use.
    - Must be accessible to PowerShell using any of the default paths.
    type: str
    required: yes
  module_version:
    description:
    - Can be used to configure the exact version of the DSC resource to be
      invoked.
    - Useful if the target node has multiple versions installed of the module
      containing the DSC resource.
    - If not specified, the module will follow standard PowerShell convention
      and use the highest version available.
    type: str
    default: latest
  free_form:
    description:
    - The M(win_dsc) module takes in multiple free form options based on the
      DSC resource being invoked by I(resource_name).
    - There is no option actually named C(free_form) so see the examples.
    - This module will try and convert the option to the correct type required
      by the DSC resource and throw a warning if it fails.
    - If the type of the DSC resource option is a C(CimInstance) or
      C(CimInstance[]), this means the value should be a dictionary or list
      of dictionaries based on the values required by that option.
    - If the type of the DSC resource option is a C(PSCredential) then there
      needs to be 2 options set in the Ansible task definition suffixed with
      C(_username) and C(_password).
    - If the type of the DSC resource option is an array, then a list should be
      provided but a comma separated string also work. Use a list where
      possible as no escaping is required and it works with more complex types
      list C(CimInstance[]).
    - If the type of the DSC resource option is a C(DateTime), you should use
      a string in the form of an ISO 8901 string to ensure the exact date is
      used.
    - Since Ansible 2.8, Ansible will now validate the input fields against the
      DSC resource definition automatically. Older versions will silently
      ignore invalid fields.
    type: str
    required: true
notes:
- By default there are a few builtin resources that come with PowerShell 5.0,
  see U(https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/dsc/resources/resources) for
  more information on these resources.
- Custom DSC resources can be installed with M(win_psmodule) using the I(name)
  option.
- The DSC engine run's each task as the SYSTEM account, any resources that need
  to be accessed with a different account need to have C(PsDscRunAsCredential)
  set.
- To see the valid options for a DSC resource, run the module with C(-vvv) to
  show the possible module invocation. Default values are not shown in this
  output but are applied within the DSC engine.
