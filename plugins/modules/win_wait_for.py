module: win_wait_for
short_description: Waits for a condition before continuing
description:
- You can wait for a set amount of time C(timeout), this is the default if
  nothing is specified.
- Waiting for a port to become available is useful for when services are not
  immediately available after their init scripts return which is true of
  certain Java application servers.
- You can wait for a file to exist or not exist on the filesystem.
- This module can also be used to wait for a regex match string to be present
  in a file.
- You can wait for active connections to be closed before continuing on a
  local port.
options:
  connect_timeout:
    description:
    - The maximum number of seconds to wait for a connection to happen before
      closing and retrying.
    type: int
    default: 5
  delay:
    description:
    - The number of seconds to wait before starting to poll.
    type: int
  exclude_hosts:
    description:
    - The list of hosts or IPs to ignore when looking for active TCP
      connections when C(state=drained).
    type: list
  host:
    description:
    - A resolvable hostname or IP address to wait for.
    - If C(state=drained) then it will only check for connections on the IP
      specified, you can use '0.0.0.0' to use all host IPs.
    type: str
    default: '127.0.0.1'
  path:
    description:
    - The path to a file on the filesystem to check.
    - If C(state) is present or started then it will wait until the file
      exists.
    - If C(state) is absent then it will wait until the file does not exist.
    type: path
  port:
    description:
    - The port number to poll on C(host).
    type: int
  regex:
    description:
    - Can be used to match a string in a file.
    - If C(state) is present or started then it will wait until the regex
      matches.
    - If C(state) is absent then it will wait until the regex does not match.
    - Defaults to a multiline regex.
    type: str
    aliases: [ "search_regex", "regexp" ]
  sleep:
    description:
    - Number of seconds to sleep between checks.
    type: int
    default: 1
  state:
    description:
    - When checking a port, C(started) will ensure the port is open, C(stopped)
      will check that is it closed and C(drained) will check for active
      connections.
    - When checking for a file or a search string C(present) or C(started) will
      ensure that the file or string is present, C(absent) will check that the
      file or search string is absent or removed.
    type: str
    choices: [ absent, drained, present, started, stopped ]
    default: started
