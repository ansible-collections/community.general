    type: bool
  proxy_url:
    description:

      option globally.
    type: str
  proxy_username:
    description:
    - Proxy username used to install Chocolatey and the package.

      option globally.
    type: str
  proxy_password:
    description:
    - Proxy password used to install Chocolatey and the package.
    - This value is exposed as a command argument and any privileged account
      can see this value when the module is running Chocolatey, define the
      password on the global config level with M(win_chocolatey_config) with
      name C(proxyPassword) to avoid this.
    type: str
  skip_scripts:
    description:

      containing C(.nupkg) packages or the name of a source defined by
      M(win_chocolatey_source).
    - This value is also used when Chocolatey is not installed as the location
      of the install.ps1 script and only supports URLs for this case.
    type: str
  source_username:
    description:
    - A username to use with I(source) when accessing a feed that requires
      authentication.
    - It is recommended you define the credentials on a source with
      M(win_chocolatey_source) instead of passing it per task.
    type: str
  source_password:
    description:
    - The password for I(source_username).
    - This value is exposed as a command argument and any privileged account
      can see this value when the module is running Chocolatey, define the

    type: str
  state:
    description:
    - State of the package on the system.
    - When C(absent), will ensure the package is not installed.
    - When C(present), will ensure the package is installed.
    - When C(downgrade), will allow Chocolatey to downgrade a package if
      I(version) is older than the installed version.
    - When C(latest), will ensure the package is installed to the latest
      available version.
    - When C(reinstalled), will uninstall and reinstall the package.
    type: str
    choices: [ absent, downgrade, latest, present, reinstalled ]
    default: present
  timeout:
    description:
    - The time to allow chocolatey to finish before timing out.
    type: int
    default: 2700
    aliases: [ execution_timeout ]
  validate_certs:
    description:
    - Used when downloading the Chocolatey install script if Chocolatey is not
      already installed, this does not affect the Chocolatey package install
      process.
    - When C(no), no SSL certificates will be validated.
    - This should only be used on personally controlled sites using self-signed
      certificate.
    type: bool
    default: yes
  version:
    description:
    - Specific version of the package to be installed.
    - When I(state) is set to C(absent), will uninstall the specific version
      otherwise all versions of that package will be removed.
    - If a different version of package is installed, I(state) must be C(latest)
      or I(force) set to C(yes) to install the desired version.
    - Provide as a string (e.g. C('6.1')), otherwise it is considered to be
      a floating-point number and depending on the locale could become C(6,1),
      which will cause a failure.
    - If I(name) is set to C(chocolatey) and Chocolatey is not installed on the
      host, this will be the version of Chocolatey that is installed. You can
      also set the C(chocolateyVersion) environment var.
    type: str
notes:
- This module will install or upgrade Chocolatey when needed.
- When using verbosity 2 or less (C(-vv)) the C(stdout) output will be restricted.
  When using verbosity 4 (C(-vvvv)) the C(stdout) output will be more verbose.
  When using verbosity 5 (C(-vvvvv)) the C(stdout) output will include debug output.
- Some packages, like hotfixes or updates need an interactive user logon in
  order to install. You can use C(become) to achieve this, see
  :ref:`become_windows`.
  Even if you are connecting as local Administrator, using C(become) to
  become Administrator will give you an interactive user logon, see examples
  below.
- If C(become) is unavailable, use M(win_hotfix) to install hotfixes instead
  of M(win_chocolatey) as M(win_hotfix) avoids using C(wusa.exe) which cannot
  be run without C(become).

# TODO:
# * Better parsing when a package has dependencies - currently fails
# * Time each item that is run
# * Support 'changed' with gems - would require shelling out to `gem list` first and parsing, kinda defeating the point of using chocolatey.
# * Version provided not as string might be translated to 6,6 depending on Locale (results in errors)
