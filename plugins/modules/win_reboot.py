module: win_reboot
short_description: Reboot a windows machine
description:
- Reboot a Windows machine, wait for it to go down, come back up, and respond to commands.
- For non-Windows targets, use the M(reboot) module instead.
options:
  pre_reboot_delay:
    description:
    - Seconds to wait before reboot. Passed as a parameter to the reboot command.
    type: int
    default: 2
    aliases: [ pre_reboot_delay_sec ]
  post_reboot_delay:
    description:
    - Seconds to wait after the reboot command was successful before attempting to validate the system rebooted successfully.
    - This is useful if you want wait for something to settle despite your connection already working.
    type: int
    default: 0
    aliases: [ post_reboot_delay_sec ]
  shutdown_timeout:
    description:
    - Maximum seconds to wait for shutdown to occur.
    - Increase this timeout for very slow hardware, large update applications, etc.
    - This option has been removed since Ansible 2.5 as the win_reboot behavior has changed.
    type: int
    default: 600
    aliases: [ shutdown_timeout_sec ]
  reboot_timeout:
    description:
    - Maximum seconds to wait for machine to re-appear on the network and respond to a test command.
    - This timeout is evaluated separately for both reboot verification and test command success so maximum clock time is actually twice this value.
    type: int
    default: 600
    aliases: [ reboot_timeout_sec ]
  connect_timeout:
    description:
    - Maximum seconds to wait for a single successful TCP connection to the WinRM endpoint before trying again.
    type: int
    default: 5
    aliases: [ connect_timeout_sec ]
  test_command:
    description:
    - Command to expect success for to determine the machine is ready for management.
    type: str
    default: whoami
  msg:
    description:
    - Message to display to users.
    type: str
    default: Reboot initiated by Ansible
  boot_time_command:
    description:
      - Command to run that returns a unique string indicating the last time the system was booted.
      - Setting this to a command that has different output each time it is run will cause the task to fail.
    type: str
    default: '(Get-WmiObject -ClassName Win32_OperatingSystem).LastBootUpTime'
notes:
- If a shutdown was already scheduled on the system, C(win_reboot) will abort the scheduled shutdown and enforce its own shutdown.
- Beware that when C(win_reboot) returns, the Windows system may not have settled yet and some base services could be in limbo.
  This can result in unexpected behavior. Check the examples for ways to mitigate this.
- The connection user must have the C(SeRemoteShutdownPrivilege) privilege enabled, see
  U(https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/force-shutdown-from-a-remote-system)
  for more information.
