module: win_file_compression
short_description: Alters the compression of files and directories on NTFS partitions.
description:
  - This module sets the compressed attribute for files and directories on a filesystem that supports it like NTFS.
  - NTFS compression can be used to save disk space.
options:
  path:
    description:
      - The full path of the file or directory to modify.
      - The path must exist on file system that supports compression like NTFS.
    required: yes
    type: path
  state:
    description:
      - Set to C(present) to ensure the I(path) is compressed.
      - Set to C(absent) to ensure the I(path) is not compressed.
    type: str
    choices:
      - absent
      - present
    default: present
  recurse:
    description:
      - Whether to recursively apply changes to all subdirectories and files.
      - This option only has an effect when I(path) is a directory.
      - When set to C(false), only applies changes to I(path).
      - When set to C(true), applies changes to I(path) and all subdirectories and files.
    type: bool
    default: false
  force:
    description:
      - This option only has an effect when I(recurse) is C(true)
      - If C(true), will check the compressed state of all subdirectories and files
        and make a change if any are different from I(compressed).
      - If C(false), will only make a change if the compressed state of I(path) is different from I(compressed).
      - If the folder structure is complex or contains a lot of files, it is recommended to set this
        option to C(false) so that not every file has to be checked.
    type: bool
    default: true

notes:
  - C(win_file_compression) sets the file system's compression state, it does not create a zip archive file.
