module: win_credential
short_description: Manages Windows Credentials in the Credential Manager
description:
- Used to create and remove Windows Credentials in the Credential Manager.
- This module can manage both standard username/password credentials as well as
  certificate credentials.
options:
  alias:
    description:
    - Adds an alias for the credential.
    - Typically this is the NetBIOS name of a host if I(name) is set to the DNS
      name.
    type: str
  attributes:
    description:
    - A list of dicts that set application specific attributes for a
      credential.
    - When set, existing attributes will be compared to the list as a whole,
      any differences means all attributes will be replaced.
    suboptions:
      name:
        description:
        - The key for the attribute.
        - This is not a unique identifier as multiple attributes can have the
          same key.
        type: str
        required: true
      data:
        description:
        - The value for the attribute.
        type: str
      data_format:
        description:
        - Controls the input type for I(data).
        - If C(text), I(data) is a text string that is UTF-16LE encoded to
          bytes.
        - If C(base64), I(data) is a base64 string that is base64 decoded to
          bytes.
        type: str
        choices: [ base64, text ]
        default: text
  comment:
    description:
    - A user defined comment for the credential.
    type: str
  name:
    description:
    - The target that identifies the server or servers that the credential is
      to be used for.
    - If the value can be a NetBIOS name, DNS server name, DNS host name suffix
      with a wildcard character (C(*)), a NetBIOS of DNS domain name that
      contains a wildcard character sequence, or an asterisk.
    - See C(TargetName) in U(https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/wincred/ns-wincred-_credentiala)
      for more details on what this value can be.
    - This is used with I(type) to produce a unique credential.
    type: str
    required: true
  persistence:
    description:
    - Defines the persistence of the credential.
    - If C(local), the credential will persist for all logons of the same user
      on the same host.
    - C(enterprise) is the same as C(local) but the credential is visible to
      the same domain user when running on other hosts and not just localhost.
    type: str
    choices: [ enterprise, local ]
    default: local
  secret:
    description:
    - The secret for the credential.
    - When omitted, then no secret is used for the credential if a new
      credentials is created.
    - When I(type) is a password type, this is the password for I(username).
    - When I(type) is a certificate type, this is the pin for the certificate.
    type: str
  secret_format:
    description:
    - Controls the input type for I(secret).
    - If C(text), I(secret) is a text string that is UTF-16LE encoded to bytes.
    - If C(base64), I(secret) is a base64 string that is base64 decoded to
      bytes.
    type: str
    choices: [ base64, text ]
    default: text
  state:
    description:
    - When C(absent), the credential specified by I(name) and I(type) is
      removed.
    - When C(present), the credential specified by I(name) and I(type) is
      removed.
    type: str
    choices: [ absent, present ]
    default: present
  type:
    description:
    - The type of credential to store.
    - This is used with I(name) to produce a unique credential.
    - When the type is a C(domain) type, the credential is used by Microsoft
      authentication packages like Negotiate.
    - When the type is a C(generic) type, the credential is not used by any
      particular authentication package.
    - It is recommended to use a C(domain) type as only authentication
      providers can access the secret.
    type: str
    required: true
    choices: [ domain_certificate, domain_password, generic_certificate, generic_password ]
  update_secret:
    description:
    - When C(always), the secret will always be updated if they differ.
    - When C(on_create), the secret will only be checked/updated when it is
      first created.
    - If the secret cannot be retrieved and this is set to C(always), the
      module will always result in a change.
    type: str
    choices: [ always, on_create ]
    default: always
  username:
    description:
    - When I(type) is a password type, then this is the username to store for
      the credential.
    - When I(type) is a credential type, then this is the thumbprint as a hex
      string of the certificate to use.
    - When C(type=domain_password), this should be in the form of a Netlogon
      (DOMAIN\Username) or a UPN (username@DOMAIN).
    - If using a certificate thumbprint, the certificate must exist in the
      C(CurrentUser\My) certificate store for the executing user.
    type: str
notes:
- This module requires to be run with C(become) so it can access the
  user's credential store.
- There can only be one credential per host and type. if a second credential is
  defined that uses the same host and type, then the original credential is
  overwritten.
