module: win_robocopy
short_description: Synchronizes the contents of two directories using Robocopy
description:
- Synchronizes the contents of files/directories from a source to destination.
- Under the hood this just calls out to RoboCopy, since that should be available
  on most modern Windows systems.
options:
  src:
    description:
    - Source file/directory to sync.
    type: path
    required: yes
  dest:
    description:
    - Destination file/directory to sync (Will receive contents of src).
    type: path
    required: yes
  recurse:
    description:
    - Includes all subdirectories (Toggles the C(/e) flag to RoboCopy).
    - If C(flags) is set, this will be ignored.
    type: bool
    default: no
  purge:
    description:
    - Deletes any files/directories found in the destination that do not exist in the source.
    - Toggles the C(/purge) flag to RoboCopy.
    - If C(flags) is set, this will be ignored.
    type: bool
    default: no
  flags:
    description:
      - Directly supply Robocopy flags.
      - If set, C(purge) and C(recurse) will be ignored.
    type: str
notes:
- This is not a complete port of the M(synchronize) module. Unlike the M(synchronize) module this only performs the sync/copy on the remote machine,
  not from the master to the remote machine.
- This module does not currently support all Robocopy flags.
