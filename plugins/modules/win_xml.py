module: win_xml
short_description: Manages XML file content on Windows hosts
description:
    - Manages XML nodes, attributes and text, using xpath to select which xml nodes need to be managed.
    - XML fragments, formatted as strings, are used to specify the desired state of a part or parts of XML files on remote Windows servers.
    - For non-Windows targets, use the M(xml) module instead.
options:
    attribute:
        description:
        - The attribute name if the type is 'attribute'.
        - Required if C(type=attribute).
        type: str
    count:
        description:
        - When set to C(yes), return the number of nodes matched by I(xpath).
        type: bool
        default: false
    backup:
        description:
        - Determine whether a backup should be created.
        - When set to C(yes), create a backup file including the timestamp information
          so you can get the original file back if you somehow clobbered it incorrectly.
        type: bool
        default: no
    fragment:
        description:
        - The string representation of the XML fragment expected at xpath.  Since ansible 2.9 not required when I(state=absent), or when I(count=yes).

    state:
        description:
