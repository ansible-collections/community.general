module: win_command
short_description: Executes a command on a remote Windows node
description:
     - The C(win_command) module takes the command name followed by a list of space-delimited arguments.
     - The given command will be executed on all selected nodes. It will not be
       processed through the shell, so variables like C($env:HOME) and operations
       like C("<"), C(">"), C("|"), and C(";") will not work (use the M(win_shell)
       module if you need these features).
     - For non-Windows targets, use the M(command) module instead.
options:
  free_form:
    description:
      - The C(win_command) module takes a free form command to run.
      - There is no parameter actually named 'free form'. See the examples!
    type: str
    required: yes
  creates:
    description:
      - A path or path filter pattern; when the referenced path exists on the target host, the task will be skipped.
    type: path
  removes:
    description:
      - A path or path filter pattern; when the referenced path B(does not) exist on the target host, the task will be skipped.
    type: path
  chdir:
    description:
      - Set the specified path as the current working directory before executing a command.
    type: path
  stdin:
    description:
    - Set the stdin of the command directly to the specified value.
    type: str
  output_encoding_override:
    description:
    - This option overrides the encoding of stdout/stderr output.
    - You can use this option when you need to run a command which ignore the console's codepage.
    - You should only need to use this option in very rare circumstances.
    - This value can be any valid encoding C(Name) based on the output of C([System.Text.Encoding]::GetEncodings()).
      See U(https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.text.encoding.getencodings).
    type: str
notes:
    - If you want to run a command through a shell (say you are using C(<),
      C(>), C(|), etc), you actually want the M(win_shell) module instead. The
      C(win_command) module is much more secure as it's not affected by the user's
      environment.
    - C(creates), C(removes), and C(chdir) can be specified after the command. For instance, if you only want to run a command if a certain file does not
      exist, use this.
