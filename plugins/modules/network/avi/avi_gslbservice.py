    avi_api_update_method:
        description:
            - Default method for object update is HTTP PUT.

    controller_health_status_enabled:
        description:
            - Gs member's overall health status is derived based on a combination of controller and datapath health-status inputs.
            - Note that the datapath status is determined by the association of health monitor profiles.
            - Only the controller provided status is determined through this configuration.
            - Default value when not specified in API or module is interpreted by Avi Controller as True.
        type: bool

    enabled:
        description:
            - Enable or disable the gslb service.
            - If the gslb service is enabled, then the vips are sent in the dns responses based on reachability and configured algorithm.
            - If the gslb service is disabled, then the vips are no longer available in the dns response.
            - Default value when not specified in API or module is interpreted by Avi Controller as True.
        type: bool

        description:
            - Verify vs health by applying one or more health monitors.
            - Active monitors generate synthetic traffic from dns service engine and to mark a vs up or down based on the response.
            - It is a reference to an object of type healthmonitor.
    health_monitor_scope:
        description:
            - Health monitor probe can be executed for all the members or it can be executed only for third-party members.
