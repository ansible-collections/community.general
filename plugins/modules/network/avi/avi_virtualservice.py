        description:
            - Specifies the virtual service acting as virtual hosting (sni) parent.

    vrf_context_ref:
        description:
            - Virtual routing context that the virtual service is bound to.
            - This is used to provide the isolation of the set of networks the application is attached to.
            - It is a reference to an object of type vrfcontext.
    vs_datascripts:
        description:
            - Datascripts applied on the data traffic of the virtual service.
    vsvip_cloud_config_cksum:

    weight:
        description:
            - The quality of service weight to assign to traffic transmitted from this virtual service.
            - A higher weight will prioritize traffic versus other virtual services sharing the same service engines.
            - Allowed values are 1-128.
            - Default value when not specified in API or module is interpreted by Avi Controller as 1.
