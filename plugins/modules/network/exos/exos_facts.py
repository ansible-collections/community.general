module: exos_facts
author:

    - "Ujwal Koamrla (@ujwalkomarla)"
short_description: Collect facts from devices running Extreme EXOS
description:
  - Collects a base set of device facts from a remote device that
    is running EXOS.  This module prepends all of the base network
    fact keys with C(ansible_net_<fact>).  The facts module will
    always collect a base set of facts from the device and can
    enable or disable collection of additional facts.
notes:
  - Tested against EXOS 22.5.1.7
options:
  gather_subset:
    description:
      - When supplied, this argument will restrict the facts collected
        to a given subset.  Possible values for this argument include
        all, hardware, config, and interfaces.  Can specify a list of
        values to include a larger subset.  Values can also be used
        with an initial C(M(!)) to specify that a specific subset should
        not be collected.
    required: false
    type: list
    default: ['!config']
  gather_network_resources:
    description:
      - When supplied, this argument will restrict the facts collected
        to a given subset. Possible values for this argument include
        all and the resources like interfaces, vlans etc.
        Can specify a list of values to include a larger subset.
        Values can also be used with an initial C(M(!)) to specify that
        a specific subset should not be collected.
        Valid subsets are 'all', 'lldp_global'.
