module: cnos_conditional_command
author: "Anil Kumar Muraleedharan (@amuraleedhar)"
short_description: Execute a single command based on condition on devices
 running Lenovo CNOS
description:
   - This module allows you to modify the running configuration of a switch. It
    provides a way to execute a single CNOS command on a network device by
    evaluating the current running configuration and executing the command only
    if the specific settings have not been already configured.
    The CNOS command is passed as an argument of the method.
    This module functions the same as the cnos_command module.
    The only exception is that following inventory variable can be specified
    ["condition = <flag string>"]
    When this inventory variable is specified as the variable of a task, the
    command is executed for the network element that matches the flag string.
    Usually, commands are executed across a group of network devices. When
    there is a requirement to skip the execution of the command on one or
    more devices, it is recommended to use this module. This module uses SSH to
    manage network device configuration.

- community.general.cnos

options:
    clicommand:
        description:
            - This specifies the CLI command as an attribute to this method.
             The command is passed using double quotes. The variables can be
             placed directly on to the CLI commands or can be invoked
             from the vars directory.
        required: true
        default: Null
    condition:
        description:
            - If you specify condition=false in the inventory file against any
             device, the command execution is skipped for that device.
        required: true
        default: Null
    flag:
        description:
            - If a task needs to be executed, you have to set the flag the same
             as it is specified in the inventory for that device.
        required: true
        default: Null
