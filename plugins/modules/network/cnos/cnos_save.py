module: cnos_save
author: "Anil Kumar Muraleedharan (@amuraleedhar)"
short_description: Save the running configuration as the startup configuration
 on devices running Lenovo CNOS
description:
    - This module allows you to copy the running configuration of a switch over
     its startup configuration. It is recommended to use this module shortly
     after any major configuration changes so they persist after a switch
     restart. This module uses SSH to manage network device configuration.
     The results of the operation will be placed in a directory named 'results'
     that must be created by the user in their local directory to where the
     playbook is run.
