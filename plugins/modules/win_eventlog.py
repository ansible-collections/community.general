module: win_eventlog
short_description: Manage Windows event logs
description:
     - Allows the addition, clearing and removal of local Windows event logs,
       and the creation and removal of sources from a given event log.  Also
       allows the specification of settings per log and source.
options:
  name:
    description:
      - Name of the event log to manage.
    type: str
    required: yes
  state:
    description:
      - Desired state of the log and/or sources.
      - When C(sources) is populated, state is checked for sources.
      - When C(sources) is not populated, state is checked for the specified log itself.
      - If C(state) is C(clear), event log entries are cleared for the target log.
    type: str
    choices: [ absent, clear, present ]
    default: present
  sources:
    description:
      - A list of one or more sources to ensure are present/absent in the log.
      - When C(category_file), C(message_file) and/or C(parameter_file) are specified,
        these values are applied across all sources.
    type: list
  category_file:
    description:
      - For one or more sources specified, the path to a custom category resource file.
    type: path
  message_file:

    description:
      - For one or more sources specified, the path to a custom parameter resource file.
    type: path
  maximum_size:
    description:
      - The maximum size of the event log.
      - Value must be between 64KB and 4GB, and divisible by 64KB.
      - Size can be specified in KB, MB or GB (e.g. 128KB, 16MB, 2.5GB).
    type: str
  overflow_action:
    description:
      - The action for the log to take once it reaches its maximum size.
      - For C(DoNotOverwrite), all existing entries are kept and new entries are not retained.
      - For C(OverwriteAsNeeded), each new entry overwrites the oldest entry.
      - For C(OverwriteOlder), new log entries overwrite those older than the C(retention_days) value.
    type: str
    choices: [ DoNotOverwrite, OverwriteAsNeeded, OverwriteOlder ]
  retention_days:
    description:
      - The minimum number of days event entries must remain in the log.
      - This option is only used when C(overflow_action) is C(OverwriteOlder).
