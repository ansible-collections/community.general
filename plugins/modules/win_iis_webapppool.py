short_description: Configure IIS Web Application Pools
description:
  - Creates, removes and configures an IIS Web Application Pool.
options:
  attributes:
    description:
      - This field is a free form dictionary value for the application pool
        attributes.
      - These attributes are based on the naming standard at
        U(https://www.iis.net/configreference/system.applicationhost/applicationpools/add#005),
        see the examples section for more details on how to set this.
      - You can also set the attributes of child elements like cpu and
        processModel, see the examples to see how it is done.
      - While you can use the numeric values for enums it is recommended to use
        the enum name itself, e.g. use SpecificUser instead of 3 for
        processModel.identityType.
      - managedPipelineMode may be either "Integrated" or "Classic".
      - startMode may be either "OnDemand" or "AlwaysRunning".
      - Use C(state) module parameter to modify the state of the app pool.
      - When trying to set 'processModel.password' and you receive a 'Value
        does fall within the expected range' error, you have a corrupted
        keystore. Please follow
        U(http://structuredsight.com/2014/10/26/im-out-of-range-youre-out-of-range/)
        to help fix your host.
  name:
    description:
      - Name of the application pool.
    type: str
    required: yes
  state:
    description:
      - The state of the application pool.
      - If C(absent) will ensure the app pool is removed.
      - If C(present) will ensure the app pool is configured and exists.
      - If C(restarted) will ensure the app pool exists and will restart, this
        is never idempotent.
      - If C(started) will ensure the app pool exists and is started.
      - If C(stopped) will ensure the app pool exists and is stopped.
