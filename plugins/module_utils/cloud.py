"""
This module adds shared support for generic cloud modules

In order to use this module, include it as part of a custom
module as shown below.

from ansible.module_utils.cloud import CloudRetry

The 'cloud' module provides the following common classes:

    * CloudRetry
        - The base class to be used by other cloud providers, in order to
          provide a backoff/retry decorator based on status codes.

        - Example using the AWSRetry class which inherits from CloudRetry.

          @AWSRetry.exponential_backoff(retries=10, delay=3)
          get_ec2_security_group_ids_from_names()

          @AWSRetry.jittered_backoff()
          get_ec2_security_group_ids_from_names()

    """ Customizable exponential backoff strategy.
    Args:
        retries (int): Maximum number of times to retry a request.
        delay (float): Initial (base) delay.
        backoff (float): base of the exponent to use for exponential
            backoff.
        max_delay (int): Optional. If provided each delay generated is capped
            at this amount. Defaults to 60 seconds.
    Returns:
        Callable that returns a generator. This generator yields durations in
        seconds to be used as delays for an exponential backoff strategy.
    Usage:
        >>> backoff = _exponential_backoff()

        delay (float): Approximate number of seconds to sleep for the first
            retry.
        max_delay (int): The maximum number of seconds to sleep for any retry.
            _random (random.Random or None): Makes this generator testable by
            allowing developers to explicitly pass in the a seeded Random.
    Returns:
        Callable that returns a generator. This generator yields durations in
        seconds to be used as delays for a full jitter backoff strategy.
