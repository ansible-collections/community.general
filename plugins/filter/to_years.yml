      description:
        - The time string to convert.
        - Can use the units V(y) and V(year) for a year, V(mo) and V(month) for a month, V(w) and V(week) for a week,
          V(d) and V(day) for a day, V(h) and V(hour) for a hour, V(m), V(min) and V(minute) for minutes, V(s), V(sec)
          and V(second) for seconds, V(ms), V(msec), V(msecond) and V(millisecond) for milliseconds. The suffix V(s)
          can be added to a unit as well, so V(seconds) is the same as V(second).

        - Examples are V(1h), V(-5m), and V(3h -5m 6s).
