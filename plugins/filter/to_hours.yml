        - The time string to convert.
        - Can use the units C(y) and C(year) for a year, C(mo) and C(month) for a month, C(w) and C(week) for a week,
          C(d) and C(day) for a day, C(h) and C(hour) for a hour, C(m), C(min) and C(minute) for minutes, C(s), C(sec)
          and C(second) for seconds, C(ms), C(msec), C(msecond) and C(millisecond) for milliseconds. The suffix C(s)
          can be added to a unit as well, so C(seconds) is the same as C(second).
