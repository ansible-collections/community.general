    version_added: '0.2.0'
    description:
        - This lookup returns the contents from a file on the Ansible controller's file system.
        - This lookup requires the C(sops) executable to be available in the controller PATH.

            required: True
    notes:
        - This lookup does not understand 'globbing' - use the fileglob lookup instead.
