# Contributing

We follow [Ansible Code of Conduct](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/code_of_conduct.html) in all our contributions and interactions within this repository.

If you are a committer, also refer to the [Ansible committer guidelines](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/community/committer_guidelines.html).

## Issue tracker

Whether you are looking for an opportunity to contribute or you found a bug and already know how to solve it, please go to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/issues).
There you can find feature ideas to implement, reports about bugs to solve, or submit an issue to discuss your idea before implementing it which can help choose a right direction at the beginning of your work and potentially save a lot of time and effort.
Also somebody may already have started discussing or working on implementing the same or a similar idea,
so you can cooperate to create a better solution together.

## Open pull requests

Look through currently [open pull requests](https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pulls).
You can help by reviewing them. Reviews help move pull requests to merge state. Some good pull requests cannot be merged only due to a lack of reviews. And it is always worth saying that good reviews are often more valuable than pull requests themselves.

Also, consider taking up a valuable, reviewed, but abandoned pull request which you could politely ask the original authors to complete yourself.

If you find any inconsistencies or places in this document which can be improved, feel free to raise an issue or pull request to fix it.
