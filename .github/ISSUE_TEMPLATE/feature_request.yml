      **Thank you for wanting to suggest a feature for ansible-core!**



      üí°
      Before you go ahead with your request, please first consider if it
      would be useful for majority of the ansible-core users. As a
      general rule of thumb, any feature that is only of interest to a
      small sub group should be [implemented in a third-party Ansible
      Collection][contribute to collections] or maybe even just your
      project alone. Be mindful of the fact that the essential
      ansible-core features have a broad impact.

      If unsure, consider filing a [new proposal] instead outlining your
      use-cases, the research and implementation considerations. Then,
      start a discussion on one of the public [IRC meetings] we have just
      for this.

      Verify first that your idea is not [already requested on
      GitHub][issue search].

      Also test if the devel branch does not already implement this.


      **Tip:** If you are seeking community support, please consider
      [starting a mailing list thread or chatting in IRC][ML||IRC].

      Describe the new feature/improvement you would like briefly below.


      What's the problem this feature will solve?

      What are you trying to do, that you are unable to achieve
      with ansible-core as it currently stands?


      * Provide examples of real-world use cases that this would enable
      and how it solves the problem you described.

      * How do you solve this now?

      * Have you tried to work around the problem using other tools?

      * Could there be a different approach to solving this issue?


      *Know **exactly** what you want?* Consider filing a [new proposal]
      instead outlining your research and implementation considerations.

        We would do it by ourselves but unfortunatelly, the curent
        edition of GitHub Issue Forms Alpha does not support this yet ü§∑


        _We will make it easier in the future, once GitHub
        supports dropdown defaults. Promise!_
