The :ansplugin:`ansible.builtin.path_join filter <ansible.builtin.path_join#filter>` has been added in ansible-base 2.10. Community.general 3.0.0 and newer contains an alias ``community.general.path_join`` for this filter that could be used on Ansible 2.9 as well. Since community.general no longer supports Ansible 2.9, this is now a simple redirect to :ansplugin:`ansible.builtin.path_join filter <ansible.builtin.path_join#filter>`.
