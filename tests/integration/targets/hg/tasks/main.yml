      The mercurial client is not able to check out Bitbucket repositories as per the changes mentioned here:
      https://bitbucket.org/blog/deprecating-tlsv1-tlsv1-1-2018-12-01 . Therefore these tests are skipped.
  when: (ansible_distribution == "Ubuntu" and ansible_distribution_version == "14.04") or ansible_python_version is version("2.7.9", "<")

  - name: install mercurial

  # As per the bitbucket changes in https://bitbucket.org/blog/deprecating-tlsv1-tlsv1-1-2018-12-01 , this
  #  test will fail under certain circumstances, to avoid false positives, we skip these tests under the following
  #  circumstances:
  #
  # - The ubuntu 14.04 image used on shippable runs python 2.7.6, so we skip explicitly for this image.
  # - When ansible_python_version is not 2.7.9 or higher, mercurial is likely to also run using this same (old)
  #   python version, which causes issues as per the link above.
  when:
  - not (ansible_distribution == "Ubuntu" and ansible_distribution_version == "14.04")
  - ansible_python_version is version("2.7.9", ">=")
