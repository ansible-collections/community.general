# This is more convoluted that one might expect, because:
#   - yay is not available or installation in ArchLinux (as it is in Manjaro - issue 6184 reports using it)
#   - to install yay in ArchLinux requires building the package
#   - makepkg cannot be run as root, but the user running it must have sudo to install the resulting package
