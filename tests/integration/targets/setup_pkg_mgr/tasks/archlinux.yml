# Since Arch Linux is a rolling distribution, it regularly needs its packages upgraded, otherwise some tests might
# stop working due to conflicts during package installation. Since there is no good way to do this on container
# startup time, we use the setup_pkg_mgr setup role to do this once per CI run (hopefully). In case the Arch Linux
# tests are run outside of a container, we're using a date-based tag (see below) to avoid this running more than
# once per day.
